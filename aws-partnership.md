# Hugging Face and Amazon Web Services start a new collaboration to make AI more accessible

<!-- {blog_metadata} -->

Keeping AI open and accessible is more important than ever! That’s the goal of a new, long-term strategic collaboration between Hugging Face and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Together, we aim to accelerate the availability of next-generation machine learning (ML) models by making them more accessible to the ML community and helping developers achieve optimal cost-effective performance.

## A new generation of open, accessible AI 

Machine learning is emerging as the new default way to build technology. As its impact on every sector of the economy comes into focus, it’s more important than ever to ensure every developer can access and assess the latest models. The strategic collaboration with AWS paves the way toward this future. 

There have been significant advances in new Transformer and Diffuser ML models that process and generate text, audio, and images. However, the latest models are less often released in open source, widening the gap of ML capabilities between the largest tech companies and everyone else. To counter this trend and deliver on our mission to democratize good machine learning, we are collaborating with AWS to contribute next-generation AI models to the global AI community.

Through the strategic collaboration, Hugging Face will leverage AWS as a Preferred Cloud Provider, and the Hugging Face research team will be one of the first in the world to leverage a cluster supercomputer, fully managed by Amazon SageMaker.

“_The future of AI is here, but it’s not evenly distributed,_” said Clement Delangue, CEO at Hugging Face. “_Accessibility and transparency are the keys to sharing progress and creating tools to use these new powers wisely and responsibly. Amazon SageMaker will enable our team and the larger machine learning community to convert the latest research into openly reproducible models that anyone can build on._”

## Collaborating to scale AI in the cloud

This new strategic collaboration enables Hugging Face and AWS to closely collaborate to accelerate machine learning adoption using the latest models from Hugging Face with the best features of Amazon SageMaker. Together, they enable customers to easily fine-tune and deploy state-of-the-art models in just a few clicks on Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2), taking advantage of purpose-built machine learning accelerators including AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia. 

“_At AWS, we are constantly innovating on behalf of our customers to make machine learning accessible to all businesses,_” said Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS. “_Our collaboration with Hugging Face makes it easier for customers to access popular machine learning models to build generative AI applications, while taking advantage of AWS-designed chips for huge price performance benefits. This collaboration demonstrates how generative AI companies and AWS can work together to create long-term value for customers._” 

Hugging Face is the leading machine learning platform, with more than [100,000 free and accessible machine learning models](https://huggingface.co/models) downloaded more than 1 million times daily by researchers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. Fine-tuning and deploying machine learning models from Hugging Face already represents billions of dollars in computing spend a year, some of it within Hugging Face [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints) and [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces), and the majority directly within major cloud providers. 

AWS is by far the most popular place to run models from the Hugging Face Hub. With Amazon SageMaker, customers can easily access fully managed infrastructure and tap into a comprehensive suite of advanced machine learning tools and workflows. Since the [start of our collaboration](https://huggingface.co/blog/the-partnership-amazon-sagemaker-and-hugging-face), [Hugging Face on Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/hugging-face/) has grown exponentially. Now, AWS offers new hardware solutions, including [Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/) and [Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/) instances that are designed from the ground up for deep learning and transformers, available through Amazon EC2 and Amazon SageMaker.
