# Results of the Open Source AI Game Jam

<!-- {blog_metadata} -->
<!-- {authors} -->

From July 7th to July 11th, **we hosted our [first Open Source AI Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/open-source-ai-game-jam)**, an exciting event that challenged game developers to create innovative games within a tight 48-hour window using AI.

The primary objective was **to create games that incorporate at least one Open Source AI Tool**. Although proprietary AI tools were allowed, we encouraged participants to integrate open-source tools into their game or workflow.

The response to our initiative was beyond our expectations, with over 1300 signups and **the submission of 88 amazing games**.

**You can try them here** 👉 https://itch.io/jam/open-source-ai-game-jam/entries

## The Theme: Expanding

To inspire creativity, **we decided on the theme of "EXPANDING."** We left it open to interpretation, allowing developers to explore and experiment with their ideas, leading to a diverse range of games.

The games were evaluated by their peers and contributors based on three key criteria: **fun, creativity, and adherence to the theme**.

The top 10 games were then presented to three judges ([Dylan Ebert](https://twitter.com/dylan_ebert_), [Thomas Simonini](https://twitter.com/ThomasSimonini) and [Omar Sanseviero](https://twitter.com/osanseviero)), **who selected the best game**.
