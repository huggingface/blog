We're thrilled to announce the first ever **Open Source AI Game Jam**, where you will create a game using AI tools.

With AI's potential to enhance game experiences and workflows, we're excited to see what you can accomplish: incorporate generative AI tools like Stable Diffusion into your game or workflow to unlock new features and accelerate your development process. 

From texture generation to lifelike NPCs and realistic text-to-speech, the options are endless.

ðŸ“† Mark your calendars: the game jam will take place from Friday to Sunday, **July 7-9**.

<h2>Why Are We Organizing This?</h2>

In a time when some popular game jams restrict the use of AI tools, we believe it's crucial to **provide a platform specifically dedicated to showcasing the incredible possibilities AI offers game developers**. Especially when those tools are **open, transparent, and accessible**.

We want to see these jams thrive and empower indie developers with the tools they need to boost productivity and unlock their full potential.

<h2>What Are AI Tools?</h2>

AI tools, particularly generative ones like Stable Diffusion, open up a whole new world of possibilities in game development.

From accelerated workflows to in-game features, you can harness the power of AI for texture generation, lifelike AI non-player characters (NPCs), and realistic text-to-speech functionality.
