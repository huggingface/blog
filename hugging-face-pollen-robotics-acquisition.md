Since Hugging Face started the LeRobot library in 2024, led by ex-Tesla lead Remi Cadene, the Hugging Face Hub has quickly become the most widely used hub and software platform for open robotics with models, datasets, spaces and libraries.

Today, weâ€™re excited to take it a step further by welcoming Pollen Robotics to Hugging Face, a team that's spent the last 9 years building open-source robots and hardware.

> "We believe robotics could be the next frontier unlocked by AI â€” and it should be open, affordable, and private. Our vision: a future where everyone in the community, from hobbyists to enterprises, can build or use robot assistants or games, starting from open solutions instead of closed, remote controlled, hardware." â€” Thomas Wolf, co-founder and chief scientist at Hugging Face

> "From the start, we built Pollen Robotics with open source at its core, driven by our belief that robots will play a profound role in our lives â€” serving as the interface between AI and the physical world. Hugging Face is a natural home for us to grow, as we share a common goal: putting AI and robotics in the hands of everyone." â€” Matthieu Lapeyre, Pollen co-founder

This marks the fifth acquisition for Hugging Face, after notable additions like [Gradio](https://x.com/Gradio) and [XetHub](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2024/08/08/hugging-face-xethub-acquisition/). 

According to Clem's 2025 [prediction about robots](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/clementdelangue_six-predictions-for-ai-in-2025-and-a-review-activity-7269341028799725568-X79a?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABNkWx4Bd1TXiJWc89LoPl7Bwii_7tkyFd4), "at least 100k personal robots will be pre-ordered" this year, signaling massive growth in the space.

This month also celebrates one year since Hugging Face created LeRobot. The community of LeRobot-native DIY robot builders has flourished on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lerobot) and [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1216765309076115607/1216765309558722622), truly democratizing access to robotics technology. In just twelve months, the GitHub repository has grown from zero to over 12,000 stars, with dramatic growth continuing into 2025.
