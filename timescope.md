# TimeScope: How Long Can Your Video Large Multimodal Model Go?

## TL;DR
_TimeScope_ is an open-source benchmark designed to measure how well vision-language models understand long videos. By splicing short “needle” clips into videos ranging from 1 minute to 8 hours, it evaluates three skills—localized retrieval, information synthesis, and fine-grained temporal perception—and reveals that many state-of-the-art models still struggle with true temporal comprehension.

Recent advances in multimodal AI have produced models claiming to understand hour-long videos. This trend mirrors progress in long-context language models, which excel at reasoning over lengthy text. Following this, vision-language systems now advertise context windows that can handle thousands of frames. But these claims require scrutiny: do these models truly demonstrate temporal comprehension, or are they limited to surface-level reti recognition? It's crucial to ask if their capabilities are being overstated.


Text benchmarks such as **HELM** and **RULER** have exposed the fragility of long-context claims, showing that models often falter when tasks demand more than simple retrieval, like reasoning or aggregation at long context lengths. In the video domain, however, we're still playing catch-up. The most common test, **Video Needle in a Haystack (VideoNIAH)**, injects static *images* as "needles" into videos, effectively measuring visual search rather than true temporal dynamics. As a result, even top-tier models advertising massive frame capacities are rarely trained beyond ~256 frames and see sharp drops on benchmarks like **Video-MME** when pushed further.

This measurement gap leaves us wondering: What does it really mean for a model to "understand" long videos? To address this, we're excited to introduce **TimeScope**, a new open-source benchmark hosted on Hugging Face. TimeScope probes the limits of long-video capabilities by inserting short (~5-10 second) *video clips*—our "needles"—into base videos ranging from 1 minute to 8 hours. With three distinct task types, it evaluates not just retrieval but synthesis, localization, and fine-grained motion analysis, providing a more holistic view of temporal comprehension.

## Why TimeScope? Motivating a Better Benchmark for Video

The promise of long-video AI is transformative — enabling agents to summarize hours of footage, detect subtle anomalies, and answer complex questions about extended narratives. Integrated into robotics, these models could analyze prolonged operations, adapt in real time, and drive autonomous decision-making. Just as powerful is the vision of a personal assistant that understands daily life and offers continuous, actionable feedback.



In practice, this leads to overstated capabilities. Models might claim to process 10,000+ frames, but training data often caps at 256 frames per clip, leading to degraded performance on longer inputs. We've seen this in evaluations where increasing frame sampling rates tanks accuracy on tasks requiring temporal insight.

TimeScope flips the script by emphasizing three pillars of long-video understanding:
1. **Localized Retrieval**: Can the model spot and answer questions about a specific short segment within a vast video?
2. **Information Synthesis**: Can it gather and order details from multiple points across the timeline?
3. **Temporal Perception**: Can it analyze motion and events in a needles that demand dense, multi-frame sampleing?


## Benchmark Design

TimeScope's core innovation lies in its utilization of 
video clips as needles, requiring more then simply sampling that particular needle in the video but rather to densely understand the entire video. We start with a long base video (e.g., a documentary, lecture, or ambient footage) and insert one or more hand-curated short video needles (5-10 seconds each) at random positions. These needles contain the key information needed to solve the task, forcing models to process the entire input without shortcuts like sparse sampling.

*Figure 1: Overview of TimeScope's needle insertion process. A long base video (1 min to 8 hours) serves as the haystack, into which we splice short video needles (~10-20 seconds). Tasks require detecting, synthesizing, or analyzing content from these needles, embedded at varying depths.*

We evaluate across three needle types, each targeting a different aspect of long-video comprehension:

### 1. General QA
This tests basic retrieval and understanding of a localized event. Questions are crafted such that sampling a single relevant frame from the needle should suffice—mimicking queries about a brief segment in a longer video.

Example:  
What mode of transportation is shown in the video?

</video>

### 2. Information Synthesis (OCR QA)
Here, we embed multiple text-based needles (e.g., 2-4 short clips displaying "secret words" via on-screen text) at different points in the video. The model must identify all words and report them in chronological order, simulating tasks like extracting timestamps or key facts from dispersed scenes. This requires scanning the full timeline and understanding relative positioning.

### 3. Fine-Grained Temporal Understanding
For questions focusing on motion or sequences within a short clip, single-frame sampling won't cut it—the model needs to perceive dynamics across frames. This probes whether long-context handling preserves temporal fidelity.

Example:  
How many times did the man swing his axe? (a) one (b) two (c) three (d) four (e) five (f) six

</video>

By varying video lengths and needle placements, TimeScope quantifies the maximum duration a model can "reasonably" claim to understand, highlighting drop-offs in performance as contexts grow.

## Baseline Evaluation Results

To kick things off, we ran TimeScope on a suite of leading vision-language models, from open-source favorites to the juggernauts like Gemini2.5-Pro. The results underscore the benchmark’s value: even models with advertised long-context prowess struggle with authentic temporal tasks at scale. These findings reveal clear patterns—performance cliffs around certain durations, strengths in static retrieval versus weaknesses in motion analysis—and pave the way for targeted improvements in model training.
