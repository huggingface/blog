# Introducing (name of the demo) Experience the Next Level of NPC Interaction

Letâ€™s find another title this one is bad ðŸ˜…

ADD THUMBNAIL HERE TOO

## Introduction

One of the most important breakthrough in using AI in games are Large Language Models (LLM) powered NPCs (Non-Playable Characters).

These intelligent characters, made possible thanks of LLM, **can engage in realistic conversations and perform complex actions, dramatically enhancing player experience**.

That's why today, we are excited to **introduce a groundbreaking demo** (NAME OF THE DEMO) created through the collaboration of [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh/) and [Gigax](https://github.com/GigaxGames/gigax) teams, showcasing the potential of smart LLM-powered NPCs.

VIDEO OF THE DEMO

You can play with the demo here ðŸ‘‰

In this demo, (describe the demo in one sentence)

To create this, the teams used three main tools:

- [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh/): the game platform.
- [Gigax](https://github.com/GigaxGames/gigax): the smart LLM-powered NPCs engine.
- [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces): for hosting the game online.

In this blog post, **we will explore Cubzh, Gigax, and how the demo works**.


## What is Cubzh?

[Cubzh](https://cu.bzh/) is an online game platform where everything is made from voxels (cubes). 

It offers a **rich gaming environment for players to build, explore, and share unique experiences**.

ADD ILLUSTRATION

With Cubzh, you can:

- **Create your own worlds** and craft new game items and avatars.

- **Code your games using the Lua programming language**.

- Play for free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1386770/Cubzh_Open_Alpha/?l=french) or [directly in your browser](https://app.cu.bzh/).

In this demo, Cubzh serves as the **game engine, providing a seamless and immersive experience**.


## What is Gigax?

[Gigax](https://github.com/GigaxGames/gigax) is a platform that **provides LLM-powered NPCs at scale**.

ADD ILLUSTRATION

By training large language models specifically for NPC interactions, **Gigax enables these characters to make decisions and perform actions based on predefined parameters**.

This makes NPCs smarter, more interactive, and more human-like.

Gigax published their models on the Hub: https://huggingface.co/Gigax

And their package is available on Github: https://github.com/GigaxGames/gigax


## The (NAME OF THE DEMO) Demo

This new demo **leverages the strengths of Cubzh and Gigax, along with Hugging Face Spaces for online hosting**.

In this demo, you'll interact with smart NPCs capable of dynamic conversations and complex behaviors (take the explanation from the introduction)
