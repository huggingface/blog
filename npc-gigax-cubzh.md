# Introducing NPC-Playground, a 3D playground to interact with LLM-powered NPCs

One of the most important breakthrough in using AI in games are Large Language Models (LLM) powered NPCs (Non-Playable Characters).

These intelligent characters, made possible thanks of LLM, **can engage in realistic conversations and perform complex actions, dramatically enhancing player experience**.

That's why today, we are excited to **introduce a groundbreaking demo** (NAME OF THE DEMO) created through the collaboration of [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh/) and [Gigax](https://github.com/GigaxGames/gigax) teams, showcasing the potential of smart LLM-powered NPCs.

VIDEO OF THE DEMO

You can play with the demo here ðŸ‘‰

In this 3D demo, you can interact with the NPCs and teach them new skills with just a few lines of Lua scripting!

To create this, the teams used three main tools:

- [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh/): the cross-platform UGC Game Engine.
- [Gigax](https://github.com/GigaxGames/gigax): the smart LLM-powered NPCs engine.
- [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces): for hosting the game online.

In this blog post, **we will explore Cubzh, Gigax, and how the demo works**.


## What is Cubzh?

[Cubzh](https://cu.bzh/) is the new UGC gaming platform to create cross-platform games with Lua and Cubes.

It offers a **rich gaming environment for players to create the best gaming experiences to play with friends.**.

ADD ILLUSTRATION

With Cubzh, you can:

- **Create your own worlds** and craft new game items and avatars.

- Use a **library of +25k free assets created by Cubzh's community**.

- **Code games using a simple but powerful Lua scripting API**.

You can download and play Cubzh for free on Desktop via [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1386770/Cubzh_Open_Alpha/), [Epic Game Store](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cubzh-3cc767), on Mobile via [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/th/app/cubzh/id1478257849), [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voxowl.pcubes.android&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) or even play directly from your [browser](https://app.cu.bzh/).

In this demo, Cubzh serves as the **game engine, providing a seamless and immersive experience**.


## What is Gigax?

[Gigax](https://github.com/GigaxGames/gigax) is the platform game developers use to run **LLM-powered NPCs at scale**.

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/181_npc-gigax-cubzh/gigax.png" alt="gigax" />

Gigax has fine-tuned large language models for NPC interactions, using the "function calling" principle. It's easier to think about this in terms of input/output flow:
- In **input**, the model reads [a text description](https://github.com/GigaxGames/gigax/blob/main/gigax/prompt.py) of a 3D scene, alongside a description of the recent events and a list of the NPC's available actions (e.g., `<say>`, `<jump>`, `<attack>`, etc.).
- The model then **outputs** one of these actions using parameters that refer to 3D entities that exist in the scene, e.g. `say NPC1 "Hello, Captain!"`.

Gigax has open-sourced their stack! You can download their [fine-tuned models on the ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/Gigax), and clone their [inference stack on Github](https://github.com/GigaxGames/gigax).


## The NPC-Playground Demo

This new demo **leverages the strengths of Cubzh and Gigax, along with Hugging Face Spaces for online hosting**.

In this demo, you'll interact with smart NPCs capable of dynamic conversations and complex behaviors (take the explanation from the introduction)

You can start playing with the demo here ðŸ‘‰ [Link to Demo]

We hope you enjoyed exploring NAME OF THE DEMO and experiencing the future of gaming with smart LLM-powered NPCs. 

The collaboration between Cubzh and Gigax has demonstrated **how advanced AI can transform NPC interactions, making them more engaging and lifelike.**
