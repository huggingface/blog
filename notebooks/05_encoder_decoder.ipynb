    "Tasks in natural language generation (NLG), a subfield of NLP, are best expressed as sequence-to-sequence problems. Such tasks can be defined as finding a model that maps a sequence of input words to a sequence of target words. Some classic examples are *summarization* and *translation*.\n",
    "In the following, we assume that each word is encoded into a vector representation. $n$ input words can then be represented as a sequence of $n$ input vectors:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{X}_{1:n} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}_n\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, sequence-to-sequence problems can be solved by finding a mapping $f$ from an input sequence of $n$ vectors $\\mathbf{X}_{1:n}$ to a sequence of $m$ target vectors $\\mathbf{Y}_{1:m}$, whereas the number of target vectors $m$ is unknown apriori and depends on the input sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f: \\mathbf{X}_{1:n} \\to \\mathbf{Y}_{1:m}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sutskever et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) noted that deep neural networks (DNN)s, \"*despite their flexibility and power can only define a mapping whose inputs and targets can be sensibly encoded with vectors of fixed dimensionality.*\"${}^1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a DNN model ${}^2$ to solve sequence-to-sequence problems would therefore mean that the number of target vectors $m$ has to be known *apriori* and would have to be independent of the input $\\mathbf{X}_{1:n}$.\n",
    "This is suboptimal because, for tasks in NLG, the number of target words usually depends on the input $\\mathbf{X}_{1:n}$ and not just on the input length $n$. \n",
    "*E.g.*, an article of 1000 words can be summarized to both 200 words and 100 words depending on its content. \n",
    "\n",

In contrast to DNNS, RNNs are capable of modeling a mapping to a variable number of target vectors. \n",
    "Let's dive a bit deeper into the functioning of RNN-based encoder-decoder models.\n",
    "\n",
    "During inference, the encoder RNN encodes an input sequence $\\mathbf{X}_{1:n}$ by successively updating its *hidden state*${}^3$. After having processed the last input vector $\\mathbf{x}_n$, the encoder's hidden state defines the input *encoding* $\\mathbf{c}$. Thus, the encoder defines the mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_{\\theta_{enc}}: \\mathbf{X}_{1:n} \\to \\mathbf{c}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the decoder's hidden state is initialized with the input encoding and during inference, the decoder RNN is used to auto-regressively generate the target sequence.\n",
    "Let's explain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the decoder defines the probability distribution of a target sequence $\\mathbf{Y}_{1:m}$ given the hidden state $\\mathbf{c}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_{\\theta_{dec}}(\\mathbf{Y}_{1:m} |\\mathbf{c}). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "By Bayes' rule the distribution can be decomposed into conditional distributions of single target vectors as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_{\\theta_{dec}}(\\mathbf{Y}_{1:m} |\\mathbf{c}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} p_{\\theta_{\\text{dec}}}(\\mathbf{y}_i | \\mathbf{Y}_{0: i-1}, \\mathbf{c}). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if the architecture can model the conditional distribution of the next target vector, given all previous target vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ p_{\\theta_{\\text{dec}}}(\\mathbf{y}_i | \\mathbf{Y}_{0: i-1}, \\mathbf{c}), \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, m\\},$$ \n",
    "\n",
    " then it can model the distribution of any target vector sequence given the hidden state $\\mathbf{c}$ by simply multiplying all conditional probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the RNN-based decoder architecture model $p_{\\theta_{\\text{dec}}}(\\mathbf{y}_i | \\mathbf{Y}_{0: i-1}, \\mathbf{c})$?\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational terms, the model sequentially maps the previous inner hidden state $\\mathbf{c}_{i-1}$ and the previous target vector $\\mathbf{y}_{i-1}$ to the current inner hidden state $\\mathbf{c}_i$ and a *logit vector* $\\mathbf{l}_i$ (shown in dark red below):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_{\\theta_{\\text{dec}}}(\\mathbf{y}_{i-1}, \\mathbf{c}_{i-1}) \\to \\mathbf{l}_i, \\mathbf{c}_i.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{c}_0$ is thereby defined as $\\mathbf{c}$ being the output hidden state of the RNN-based encoder. \n",
    "Subsequently, the *softmax* operation is used to transform the logit vector $\\mathbf{l}_i$ to a conditional probablity distribution of the next target vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(\\mathbf{y}_i | \\mathbf{l}_i) = \\textbf{Softmax}(\\mathbf{l}_i), \\text{ with } \\mathbf{l}_i = f_{\\theta_{\\text{dec}}}(\\mathbf{y}_{i-1}, \\mathbf{c}_{\\text{prev}}). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detail on the logit vector and the resulting probability distribution, please see footnote ${}^4$.\n",
    "From the above equation, we can see that the distribution of the current target vector $\\mathbf{y}_i$ is directly conditioned on the previous target vector $\\mathbf{y}_{i-1}$ and the previous hidden state $\\mathbf{c}_{i-1}$. Because the previous hidden state $\\mathbf{c}_{i-1}$ depends on all previous target vectors $\\mathbf{y}_0, \\ldots, \\mathbf{y}_{i-2}$, it can be stated that the RNN-based decoder *implicitly* (*e.g.* *indirectly*) models the conditional distribution $p_{\\theta_{\\text{dec}}}(\\mathbf{y}_i | \\mathbf{Y}_{0: i-1}, \\mathbf{c})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space of possible target vector sequences $\\mathbf{Y}_{1:m}$ is prohibitively large so that at inference, one has to rely on decoding methods ${}^5$ that efficiently sample high probability target vector sequences from $p_{\\theta_{dec}}(\\mathbf{Y}_{1:m} |\\mathbf{c})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given such a decoding method, during inference, the next input vector $\\mathbf{y}_i$ can then be sampled from $p_{\\theta_{\\text{dec}}}(\\mathbf{y}_i | \\mathbf{Y}_{0: i-1}, \\mathbf{c})$ and is consequently appended to the input sequence so that the decoder RNN then models $p_{\\theta_{\\text{dec}}}(\\mathbf{y}_{i+1} | \\mathbf{Y}_{0: i}, \\mathbf{c})$ to sample the next input vector $\\mathbf{y}_{i+1}$ and so on in *auto-regressive* fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important feature of RNN-based encoder-decoder models is the definition of *special* vectors, such as the $\\text{EOS}$ and $\\text{BOS}$ vector. The $\\text{EOS}$ vector often represents the final input vector $\\mathbf{x}_n$ to \"cue\" the encoder that the input sequence has ended and also defines the end of the target sequence. As soon as the $\\text{EOS}$ is sampled from a logit vector, the generation is complete. \n",
    "The $\\text{BOS}$ vector represents the input vector $\\mathbf{y}_0$ fed to the decoder RNN at the very first decoding step. To output the first logit $\\mathbf{l}_1$, an input is required and since no input has been generated at the first step a special $\\text{BOS}$ input vector is fed to the decoder RNN.\n",
    "Ok - quite complicated! Let's illustrate and walk through an example.\n",

    "The encoder RNN then processes the rest of the input sentence $\\text{want}$, $\\text{to}$, $\\text{buy}$, $\\text{a}$, $\\text{car}$, $\\text{EOS}$ in the same fashion, updating its hidden state at each step until the vector $\\mathbf{x}_7={EOS}$ is reached ${}^6$. In the illustration above the horizontal arrow connecting the unfolded encoder RNN represents the sequential updates of the hidden state.\n",

Thereby, the weights are proportional to the cosine similarity between $\\mathbf{q}_j$ and the respective key vectors $\\mathbf{k}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{k}_n$, which is mathematically expressed by $\\textbf{Softmax}(\\mathbf{K}_{1:n}^\\intercal \\mathbf{q}_j)$ as illustrated in the equation below.\n",

    "To further understand the implications of the bi-directional self-attention layer, let's assume the following sentence is processed: \"*The house is beautiful and well located in the middle of the city where it is easily accessible by public transport*\". The word \"it\" refers to \"house\", which is 12 \"positions away\". In transformer-based encoders, the bi-directional self-attention layer performs a single mathematical operation to put the input vector of \"house\" into relation with the input vector of \"it\" (compare to the first illustration of this section). In contrast, in an RNN-based encoder, a word that is 12 \"positions away\", would require at least 12 mathematical operations meaning that in an RNN-based encoder a linear number of mathematical operations are required. This makes it much harder for an RNN-based encoder to model long-range contextual representations.\n",
    "Also, it becomes clear that a transformer-based encoder is much less prone to lose important information than an RNN-based encoder-decoder model because the sequence length of the encoding is kept the same, *i.e.* $\\textbf{len}(\\mathbf{X}_{1:n}) = \\textbf{len}(\\mathbf{\\overline{X}}_{1:n}) = n$, while an RNN compresses the length from $\\textbf{len}((\\mathbf{X}_{1:n}) = n$ to just $\\textbf{len}(\\mathbf{c}) = 1$, which makes it very difficult for RNNs to effectively encode long-range dependencies between input words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to making long-range dependencies more easily learnable, we can see that the Transformer architecture is able to process text in parallel.Mathematically, this can easily be shown by writing the self-attention formula as a product of query, key, and value matrices:\n",

    "\n",
    "The output $\\mathbf{X''}_{1:n} = \\mathbf{x''}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x''}_n$ is computed via a series of matrix multiplications and a softmax operation, which can be parallelized effectively. \n",
    "Note, that in an RNN-based encoder model, the computation of the hidden state $\\mathbf{c}$ has to be done sequentially: Compute hidden state of the first input vector $\\mathbf{x}_1$, then compute the hidden state of the second input vector that depends on the hidden state of the first hidden vector, etc. The sequential nature of RNNs prevents effective parallelization and makes them much more inefficient compared to transformer-based encoder models on modern GPU hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, now we should have a better understanding of a) how transformer-based encoder models effectively model long-range contextual representations and b) how they efficiently process long sequences of input vectors. \n",

In the lower part, the uni-directional self-attention mechanism is illustrated and in the middle, the cross-attention mechanism is illustrated. Let's first focus on uni-directional self-attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in bi-directional self-attention, in uni-directional self-attention, the query vectors $\\mathbf{q}_0, \\ldots, \\mathbf{q}_{m-1}$ (shown in purple below), key vectors $\\mathbf{k}_0, \\ldots, \\mathbf{k}_{m-1}$ (shown in orange below), and value vectors $\\mathbf{v}_0, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_{m-1}$ (shown in blue below) are projected from their respective input vectors $\\mathbf{y'}_0, \\ldots, \\mathbf{y'}_{m-1}$ (shown in light red below).

As is the case in bi-directional self-attention, the attention weights are then multiplied by their respective value vectors and summed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize uni-directional self-attention as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{y''}_i = \\mathbf{V}_{0: i} \\textbf{Softmax}(\\mathbf{K}_{0: i}^\\intercal \\mathbf{q}_i) + \\mathbf{y'}_i. $$\n",

    "Note that the index range of the key and value vectors is $0:i$ instead of $0: m-1$ which would be the range of the key vectors in bi-directional self-attention.\n",

    "Let's illustrate uni-directional self-attention for the input vector $\\mathbf{y'}_1$ for our example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/encoder_decoder/causal_attn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen $\\mathbf{y''}_1$ only depends on $\\mathbf{y'}_0$ and $\\mathbf{y'}_1$. Therefore, we put the vector representation of the word \"Ich\", *i.e.* $\\mathbf{y'}_1$ only into relation with itself and the \"BOS\" target vector, *i.e.* $\\mathbf{y'}_0$, but **not** with the vector representation of the word \"will\", *i.e.* $\\mathbf{y'}_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is it important that we use uni-directional self-attention in the decoder instead of bi-directional self-attention? \n",
    "As stated above, a transformer-based decoder defines a mapping from a sequence of input vector $\\mathbf{Y}_{0: m-1}$ to the logits corresponding to the **next** decoder input vectors, namely $\\mathbf{L}_{1:m}$.\n",
    "In our example, this means, *e.g.* that the input vector $\\mathbf{y}_1$ = \"Ich\" is mapped to the logit vector $\\mathbf{l}_2$, which is then used to predict the input vector $\\mathbf{y}_2$. Thus, if $\\mathbf{y'}_1$ would have access to the following input vectors $\\mathbf{Y'}_{2:5}$, the decoder would simply copy the vector representation of \"will\", *i.e.* $\\mathbf{y'}_2$, to be its output $\\mathbf{y''}_1$. This would be forwarded to the last layer so that the encoded output vector $\\mathbf{\\overline{y}}_1$ would essentially just correspond to the vector representation $\\mathbf{y}_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is obviously disadvantageous as the transformer-based decoder would never learn to predict the next word given all previous words, but just copy the target vector $\\mathbf{y}_i$ through the network to $\\mathbf{\\overline{y}}_{i-1}$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, m \\}$. In order to define a conditional distribution of the next target vector, the distribution cannot be conditioned on the next target vector itself. It does not make much sense to predict $\\mathbf{y}_i$ from $p(\\mathbf{y} | \\mathbf{Y}_{0:i}, \\mathbf{\\overline{X}})$ because the distribution is conditioned on the target vector it is supposed to model.\n",
    "The uni-directional self-attention architecture, therefore, allows us to define a *causal* probability distribution, which is necessary to effectively model a conditional distribution of the next target vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now we can move to the layer that connects the encoder and decoder - the *cross-attention* mechanism!\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-attention layer takes two vector sequences as inputs: the outputs of the uni-directional self-attention layer, *i.e.* $\\mathbf{Y''}_{0: m-1}$ and the contextualized encoding vectors $\\mathbf{\\overline{X}}_{1:n}$.\n",
    "As in the self-attention layer, the query vectors $\\mathbf{q}_0, \\ldots, \\mathbf{q}_{m-1}$ are projections of the output vectors of the previous layer, *i.e.* $\\mathbf{Y''}_{0: m-1}$.

Having defined key, value, and query vectors, a query vector $\\mathbf{q}_i$ is then compared to *all* key vectors and the corresponding score is used to weight the respective value vectors, just as is the case for *bi-directional* self-attention to give the output vector $\\mathbf{y'''}_i$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\ldots, m-1\\}. Cross-attention can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{y'''}_i = \\mathbf{V}_{1:n} \\textbf{Softmax}(\\mathbf{K}_{1: n}^\\intercal \\mathbf{q}_i) + \\mathbf{y''}_i.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the index range of the key and value vectors is $1:n$ corresponding to the number of contextualized encoding vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visualize the cross-attention mechanism for the input vector $\\mathbf{y''}_1$ for our example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/encoder_decoder/cross_attention.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the query vector $\\mathbf{q}_1$ (shown in purple) is derived from $\\mathbf{y''}_1$ (shown in red) and therefore relies on a vector representation of the word \"Ich\". The query vector $\\mathbf{q}_1$ is then compared to the key vectors $\\mathbf{k}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{k}_7$ (shown in yellow) corresponding to the contextual encoding representation of all encoder input vectors $\\mathbf{X}_{1:n}$ = \"I want to buy a car EOS\". This puts the vector representation of \"Ich\" into direct relation with all encoder input vectors. Finally, the attention weights are multiplied by the value vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_7$ (shown in turquoise) to yield in addition to the input vector $\\mathbf{y''}_1$ the output vector $\\mathbf{y'''}_1$ (shown in dark red). \n",
    "\n",
    "So intuitively, what happens here exactly? \n",
    "Each output vector $\\mathbf{y'''}_i$ is a weighted sum of all value projections of the encoder inputs $\\mathbf{v}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_7$ plus the input vector itself $\\mathbf{y''}_i$ (*c.f.* illustrated formula above). The key mechanism to understand is the following: Depending on how similar a query projection of the *input decoder vector* $\\mathbf{q}_i$ is to a key projection of the *encoder input vector* $\\mathbf{k}_j$, the more important is the value projection of the encoder input vector $\\mathbf{v}_j$. In loose terms this means, the more \"related\" a decoder input representation is to an encoder input representation, the more does the input representation influence the decoder output representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cool! Now we can see how this architecture nicely conditions each output vector $\\mathbf{y'''}_i$ on the interaction between the encoder input vectors $\\mathbf{\\overline{X}}_{1:n}$ and the input vector $\\mathbf{y''}_i$. \n",
    "Another important observation at this point is that the architecture is completely independent of the number $n$ of contextualized encoding vectors $\\mathbf{\\overline{X}}_{1:n}$ on which the output vector $\\mathbf{y'''}_i$ is conditioned on. All projection matrices $\\mathbf{W}^{\\text{cross}}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{W}^{\\text{cross}}_{v}$ to derive the key vectors $\\mathbf{k}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{k}_n$ and the value vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_n$ respectively are shared across all positions $1, \\ldots, n$ and all value vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_n$ are summed together to a single weighted averaged vector.\n",
    "Now it becomes obvious as well, why the transformer-based decoder does not suffer from the long-range dependency problem, the RNN-based decoder suffers from. Because each decoder logit vector is *directly* dependent on every single encoded output vector, the number of mathematical operations to compare the first encoded output vector and the last decoder logit vector amounts essentially to just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, the uni-directional self-attention layer is responsible for conditioning each output vector on all previous decoder input vectors and the current input vector and the cross-attention layer is responsible to further condition each output vector on all encoded input vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify our theoretical understanding, let's continue our code example from the encoder section above.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "${}^1$ The word embedding matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{\\text{emb}}$ gives each input word a unique *context-independent* vector representation. This matrix is often fixed as the \"LM Head\" layer. However, the \"LM Head\" layer can very well consist of a completely independent \"encoded vector-to-logit\" weight mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "${}^2$ Again, an in-detail explanation of the role the feed-forward layers play in transformer-based models is out-of-scope for this notebook. It is argued in [Yun et. al, (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10077.pdf) that feed-forward layers are crucial to map each contextual vector $\\mathbf{x'}_i$ individually to the desired output space, which the *self-attention* layer does not manage to do on its own. It should be noted here, that each output token $\\mathbf{x'}$ is processed by the same feed-forward layer. For more detail, the reader is advised to read the paper.\n"
