        "This blog post assumes that the reader is familiar with text generation methods using the different variants of beam search, as explained in in the blog post: [\"How to generate text: using different decoding methods for language generation with Transformers\"](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate)\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike ordinary beam search, **constrained** beam search allows us to exert control over the output of text generation. This is useful because, sometimes, we know exactly what we want inside the output. For example, in a Neural Machine Translation task, we might know which words must be included in the final translation with a dictionary lookup. Sometimes, generation outputs that are almost equally possible to a language model might not be equally deseriable for the end-user due to the particular context. Both of these situations could be solved by allowing the users to tell the model which words must be included in the end output. \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why It's Difficult**\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this is actually a very non-trivial problem. This is because the task requires us to force the generation of certain subsequences *somewhere* in the final output, at *some point* during the generation. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say that we're want to generate a sentence `S` that has to include the phrase $p_1=\\{ t_1, t_2 \\}$ with tokens $t_1, t_2$ in order. Let's define the expected sentence $S$ as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$S_{expected} = \\{ s_1, s_2, ..., s_k, t_1, t_2, s_{k+1}, ..., s_n \\}$ \n",
        "\n",
        "The problem is that beam search generates the sequence *token-by-token*. Though not entirely accurate, one can think of beam search as the function $B(\\mathbf{s}_{0:i}) = s_{i+1}$, where it looks at the currently generated sequence of tokens from $0$ to $i$ then predicts the next token at $i+1$. But how can this function know, at an arbitrary step $i < k$, that the tokens must be generated at some future step $k$? Or when it's at the step $i=k$, how can it know for sure that this is the best spot to force the tokens, instead of some future step $i>k$?\n",

        "And what if you have multiple constraints with varying requirements? What if you want to force the phrase $p_1=\\{t_1, t_2\\}$ *and* also the phrase $p_2=\\{ t_3, t_4, t_5, t_6\\}$? What if you want the model to **choose between** the two phrases? What if we want to force the phrase $p_1$ and force just one phrase among the list of phrases $\\{p_{21}, p_{22}, p_{23}\\}$? \n",

        "Constrained beam search gives us a flexible means to inject external knowledge and requirements into text generation. Previously, there was no easy way to tell the model to 1. include a list of sequences where 2. some of which are optional and some are not, such that 3. they're generated *somewhere* in the sequence at reasonable respective positions. Now, with a mix of different subclasses of `Constraint` objects, we can have full control over our generation! \n",
