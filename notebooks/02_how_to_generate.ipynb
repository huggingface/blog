        "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in open-ended language generation thanks to the rise of large transformer-based language models trained on millions of webpages, such as OpenAI's famous [GPT2 model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/). The results on conditioned open-ended language generation are impressive, e.g. [GPT2 on unicorns](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#samples), [XLNet](https://medium.com/@amanrusia/xlnet-speaks-comparison-to-gpt-2-ea1a4e9ba39e), [Controlled language with CTRL](https://blog.einstein.ai/introducing-a-conditional-transformer-language-model-for-controllable-generation/). Besides the improved transformer architecture and massive unsupervised training data, **better decoding methods** have also played an important role. \n",

        "All of the following functionalities can be used for **auto-regressive** language generation ([here](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/) a refresher). In short, *auto-regressive* language generation is based on the assumption that the probability distribution of a word sequence can be decomposed into the product of conditional next word distributions: \n",

        "\n",
        "and $W_0$ being the initial *context* word sequence. The length $T$ of the word sequence is usually determined *on-the-fly* and corresponds to the timestep $t=T$ the EOS token is generated from $P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_{0})$.\n",

(2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858) and is also used in the training objective in [Welleck et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04319.pdf). It can be quite effective at preventing repetitions, but seems to be very sensitive to different models and use cases, *e.g.* see this [discussion](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/2303) on Github.\n",
