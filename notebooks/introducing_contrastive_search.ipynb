      "DeepMind's work on Go began in 2010, when it began to train a neural network to play Go using millions of games played by top Go players around the world. Since then, the team has refined the algorithm, adding more and more layers of reinforcement learning to make it better at recognizing patterns and making decisions based on those patterns. In the past year and a half, the team has made significant progress in the game, winning a record-tying 13 games in a row to move into the top four of the world rankings.\n",

      "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. The theory focuses on several aspects of learning, including the dynamics of replicative and non-replicative aspects of learning. This framework emphasizes learning by entropy. New randomized algorithms enable training networks with residual learning, so that deep networks can be deployed as reliably and as efficiently as their more conventional counterparts.\n",

      "In this paper, we propose a model-based residual learning (MBRL) framework that is based on neural networks trained on data that is sparse in terms of dimensionality (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.). The network parameters are chosen such that there is a high probability of convergence, i.e., the number of iterations is large enough to minimize the variance of the residuals. This is achieved by training the network on a set of training data, in which the data is sparse in terms of dimensionality, and then discarding the nonparametric part of the data after training is complete.\n",

      "We show that MBRL outperforms other methods for deep reinforcement learning (RL) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by a factor of at least 2. In addition, we show that, compared to CNNs, MBRL performs better in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cases.\n",
