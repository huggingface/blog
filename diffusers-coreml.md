Thanks to Apple engineers, you can now run Stable Diffusion on Apple Silicon using Core ML!

[This Apple repo](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion) provides conversion scripts and inference code based on [ðŸ§¨ Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), and we love it! To make it as easy as possible for you, we converted the weights ourselves and put the Core ML versions of the models in [the Hugging Face Hub](https://hf.co/apple).

This post guides you on how to use the converted weights.

## Available Checkpoints

The checkpoints that are already converted and ready for use are the ones for these models:

- Stable Diffusion v1.4: [converted](https://hf.co/apple/coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-4) [original](https://hf.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)
- Stable Diffusion v1.5: [converted](https://hf.co/apple/coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-5) [original](https://hf.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5)
- Stable Diffusion v2 base: [converted](https://hf.co/apple/coreml-stable-diffusion-2-base) [original](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-base)

Core ML supports all the compute units available in your device: CPU, GPU and Apple's Neural Engine (NE). It's also possible for Core ML to run different portions of the model in different devices to maximize performance.

There are several variants of each model that may yield different performance depending on the hardware you use. We recommend you try them out and stick with the one that works best in your system. Read on for details.

## Notes on Performance

There are 8 different variants per model. They are:

- "Chunked" vs "unchunked" UNet. The chunked version splits the large UNet checkpoint in several files. This is only required if you intend to run the models on iPadOS or iOS, but is not necessary for macOS.
- "Original" attention vs "split_einsum". These are two alternative implementations of the critical attention blocks. `split_einsum` was previously introduced by Apple, and is compatible with all the compute units (CPU, GPU and Apple's Neural Engine). `original`, on the other hand, is only compatible with CPU and GPU. Nevertheless, `original` can be faster than `split_einsum` on some devices, so do check it out!
- "ML Packages" vs "Compiled" models. The former is suitable for Python inference, while the `compiled` version is required for Swift code.

At the time of this writing, we got best results on my MacBook Pro (M1 Max, 32 GPU cores, 64 GB) using the following combination:

- `original` attention.
- `all` compute units (see next section for details).
- macOS Ventura 13.1 Beta 3 (22C5050e). Beta 4 _just came out_, we'll update this note when we test it!

With these, it took 18s to generate one image with the Core ML version of Stable Diffusion v1.4 ðŸ¤¯.

Each model repo is organized in a tree structure that provides all these different variants:

```
coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-4
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ original
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ compiled
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ packages
â””â”€â”€ split_einsum
    â”œâ”€â”€ compiled
    â””â”€â”€ packages
```

You can download and use the variant you need as shown below.

## Core ML Inference in Python

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
pip install git+https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion
```

### Download the Model Checkpoints

To run inference in Python, you have to use one of the versions stored in the `packages` folders, because the compiled ones are only compatible with Swift. You may choose whether you want to use the `original` or `split_einsum` attention styles.

This is how you'd download the `original` attention variant from the Hub:

```Python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

repo_id = "apple/coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-4"
variant = "original/packages"

downloaded = snapshot_download(repo_id, allow_patterns=f"{variant}/*")
```

Note how the `variant` string reflects the tree structure shown above. Also note that you can download the models to a folder of your choosing by using the additional argument `cache_dir`, for example:

```Python
downloaded = snapshot_download(repo_id, allow_patterns=f"{variant}/*", cache_dir="./models")
```

### Inference

Once you have downloaded a snapshot of the model, the easiest way to run inference would be to use Apple's Python script.

```shell
python -m python_coreml_stable_diffusion.pipeline --prompt "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars" -i <output-mlpackages-directory> -o </path/to/output/image> --compute-unit ALL --seed 93
```

`<output-mlpackages-directory>` should point to the snaphost you downloaded in the step above, and `--compute-unit` indicates the hardware you want to allow for inference. It must be one of the following options: `ALL`, `CPU_AND_GPU`, `CPU_ONLY`, `CPU_AND_NE`. You may also provide an optional output path, and a seed for reproducibility.

## Core ML inference in Swift

Running inference in Swift is slightly faster than in Python, because the models are already compiled in the `mlmodelc` format. This will be noticeable on app startup when the model is loaded, but shouldnâ€™t be noticeable if you run several generations afterwards.

### Download

To run inference in Swift on your Mac, you need one of the `compiled` checkpoint versions. We recommend you download them locally using Python code similar to the one we showed above:

```Python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

repo_id = "apple/coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-4"
variant = "original/compiled"

downloaded = snapshot_download(repo_id, allow_patterns=f"{variant}/*")
```

### Inference

To run inference, please clone Apple's repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion
cd ml-stable-diffusion
```

And then use Apple's command-line tool using Swift Package Manager's facilities:

```bash
swift run StableDiffusionSample --resource-path models/compiled --compute-units all "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
```

`models/compiled` refers to the checkpoint you downloaded in the previous step. Please, make sure it contains compiled Core ML bundles with the extension `.mlmodelc`. The `--compute-units` has to be one of these values: `all`, `cpuOnly`, `cpuAndGPU`, `cpuAndNeuralEngine`.

For more details, please refer to the [instructions in Apple's repo](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion).

## Bring Your own Model

If you have created your own models compatible with Stable Diffusion (for example, if you used Dreambooth, Textual Inversion or fine-tuning), then you have to convert the models yourself. Fortunately, Apple provides a conversion script that allows you to do so.

For this task, we recommend you follow [these instructions](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#converting-models-to-coreml).

## Next Steps

We are really excited about the opportunities this brings and can't wait to see what the community can create from here. Some potential ideas are:

- Native, high-quality apps for Mac, iPhone and iPad.
- Bring additional schedulers to Swift, for even faster inference.
- Additional pipelines and tasks.
- Explore quantization techniques and further optimizations.

Looking forward to seeing what you create!
