We are happy to share an open-source partnership between HuggingFace and [PaddlePaddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/en), the most popular Chinese Deep Learning platform in the world’s most populous country!

First open-sourced by Baidu in 2016, PaddlePaddle enables developers of all skill levels to adopt and implement Deep Learning at scale. As of Q2 2022, PaddlePaddle is being used by more than 4.77 million developers and 180,000 enterprises, ranking first in terms of market share among Deep Learning platforms in China. 

With [PaddleNLP]()



Hugging Face makes it really easy to share your spaCy pipelines with the community! With a single command, you can upload any pipeline package, with a pretty model card and all required metadata auto-generated for you. The inference API currently supports NER out-of-the-box, and you can try out your pipeline interactively in your browser. You'll also get a live URL for your package that you can `pip install` from anywhere for a smooth path from prototype all the way to production!
1. PaddlePaddle加入HF生态，共建开源社区. 然后PP简介(大部分人没听过PP)
2. 由PaddleNLP打头，PP将会逐步融入HF生态。画个饼提一下PP其他比较大的库例如PaddleOCR, PaddleDet, 但是不需要有实质工作.
3. 当前PaddleNLP兼容HF后的使用体验和介绍，包括Model Hub, Inference API, Space. 再介绍一下Paddle明显模型
