Just as transformers-based models have revolutionized NLP, we're now seeing an explosion of papers applying them to all sorts of other domains. One of the most revolutionary of these was the Vision Transformer (ViT), which was introduced in [June 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) by a team of researchers at Google Brain.

This paper explored how you can tokenize images, just as you would tokenize sentences, so that they can be passed to transformer models for training. It's quite a simple concept, really...

1. Split an image into a grid of sub-image patches
1. Embed each patch with a linear projection
1. Each embedded patch becomes a token, and the resulting sequence of embedded patches is the sequence you pass to the model.

It turns out that once you've done the above, you can pre-train and fine-tune transformers just as you're used to with NLP tasks. Pretty sweet üòé.

In this blog post, we'll walk through how to leverage ü§ó `datasets` to download and process image classification datasets, and then use them to fine-tune a pre-trained ViT with ü§ó `transformers`. 

To get started, let's first install both those packages.


```bash
pip install datasets transformers
```

## Load a dataset

Let's start by loading a small image classification dataset and taking a look at its structure.

We'll use the [`beans`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/beans) dataset, which is a collection of pictures of healthy and unhealthy bean leaves. üçÉ


```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = load_dataset('beans')
ds
```

Let's take a look at the 400th example from the `'train'` split from the beans dataset. You'll notice each example from the dataset has 3 features:

1. `image`: A PIL Image
1. `image_file_path`: The `str` path to the image file that was loaded as `image`
1. `labels`: A [`datasets.ClassLabel`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html?highlight=classlabel#datasets.ClassLabel) feature, which is an integer representation of the label. (Later you'll see how to get the string class names, don't worry!)


```python
ex = ds['train'][400]
ex
```


    {
      'image': <PIL.JpegImagePlugin ...>,
      'image_file_path': '/root/.cache/.../bean_rust_train.4.jpg',
      'labels': 1
    }



Let's take a look at the image üëÄ


```python
image = ex['image']
image
```

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <medium-zoom background="rgba(0,0,0,.7)" alt="A leaf!" src="assets/51_fine_tune_vit/example-leaf.jpg"></medium-zoom>
</figure>

That's definitely a leaf! But what kind? üòÖ

Since the `'labels'` feature of this dataset is a `datasets.features.ClassLabel`, we can use it to look up the corresponding name for this example's label ID.

First, let's access the feature definition for the `'labels'`.


```python
labels = ds['train'].features['labels']
labels
```




    ClassLabel(num_classes=3, names=['angular_leaf_spot', 'bean_rust', 'healthy'], names_file=None, id=None)



Now, let's print out the class label for our example. You can do that by using the [`int2str`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html?highlight=classlabel#datasets.ClassLabel.int2str) function of `ClassLabel`, which, as the name implies, allows to pass the integer representation of the class to look up the string label.


```python
labels.int2str(ex['labels'])
```




    'bean_rust'



Turns out the leaf shown above is infected with Bean Rust, a serious disease in bean plants. üò¢

Let's write a function that'll display a grid of examples from each class to get a better idea of what you're working with.


```python
import random
from PIL import ImageDraw, ImageFont, Image

def show_examples(ds, seed: int = 1234, examples_per_class: int = 3, size=(350, 350)):

    w, h = size
    labels = ds['train'].features['labels'].names
    grid = Image.new('RGB', size=(examples_per_class * w, len(labels) * h))
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(grid)
    font = ImageFont.truetype("/usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationMono-Bold.ttf", 24)

    for label_id, label in enumerate(labels):

        # Filter the dataset by a single label, shuffle it, and grab a few samples
        ds_slice = ds['train'].filter(lambda ex: ex['labels'] == label_id).shuffle(seed).select(range(examples_per_class))

        # Plot this label's examples along a row
        for i, example in enumerate(ds_slice):
            image = example['image']
            idx = examples_per_class * label_id + i
            box = (idx % examples_per_class * w, idx // examples_per_class * h)
            grid.paste(image.resize(size), box=box)
            draw.text(box, label, (255, 255, 255), font=font)

    return grid

show_examples(ds, seed=random.randint(0, 1337), examples_per_class=3)
```



<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full">
  <medium-zoom background="rgba(0,0,0,.7)" alt="A leaf!" src="assets/51_fine_tune_vit/leaf-grid.jpg"></medium-zoom>
  <figcaption>A grid of a few examples from each class in the dataset</figcaption>
</figure>



From what I'm seeing, 
- Angular Leaf Spot: Has irregular brown patches
- Bean Rust:  Has circular brown spots surrounded with a white-ish yellow ring
- Healthy: ...looks healthy. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Loading ViT Feature Extractor

Now we know what our images look like and better understand the problem we're trying to solve. Let's see how we can prepare these images for our model!

When ViT models are trained, specific transformations are applied to images fed into them. Use the wrong transformations on your image, and the model won't understand what it's seeing! üñº ‚û°Ô∏è üî¢

To make sure we apply the correct transformations, we will use a [`ViTFeatureExtractor`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vit#transformers.ViTFeatureExtractor) initialized with a configuration that was saved along with the pretrained model we plan to use. In our case, we'll be using the [google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) model, so let's load its feature extractor from the Hugging Face Hub.


```python
from transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor

model_name_or_path = 'google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k'
feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)
```

You can see the feature extractor configuration by printing it.


    ViTFeatureExtractor {
      "do_normalize": true,
      "do_resize": true,
      "feature_extractor_type": "ViTFeatureExtractor",
      "image_mean": [
        0.5,
        0.5,
        0.5
      ],
      "image_std": [
        0.5,
        0.5,
        0.5
      ],
      "resample": 2,
      "size": 224
    }



To process an image, simply pass it to the feature extractor's call function. This will return a dict containing `pixel values`, which is the numeric representation to be passed to the model.

You get a NumPy array by default, but if you add the `return_tensors='pt'` argument, you'll get back `torch` tensors instead.



```python
feature_extractor(image, return_tensors='pt')
```

Should give you something like...

    {
      'pixel_values': tensor([[[[ 0.2706,  0.3255,  0.3804,  ...]]]])
    }

...where the shape of the tensor is `(1, 3, 224, 224)`.

## Processing the Dataset

Now that you know how to read images and transform them into inputs, let's write a function that will put those two things together to process a single example from the dataset.


```python
def process_example(example):
    inputs = feature_extractor(example['image'], return_tensors='pt')
    inputs['labels'] = example['labels']
    return inputs
```


```python
process_example(ds['train'][0])
```


    {
      'pixel_values': tensor([[[[-0.6157, -0.6000, -0.6078,  ..., ]]]]),
      'labels': 0
    }



While you could call `ds.map` and apply this to every example at once, this can be very slow, especially if you use a larger dataset. Instead, you can apply a ***transform*** to the dataset. Transforms are only applied to examples as you index them.

First, though, you'll need to update the last function to accept a batch of data, as that's what `ds.with_transform` expects.


```python
ds = load_dataset('beans')

def transform(example_batch):
    # Take a list of PIL images and turn them to pixel values
    inputs = feature_extractor([x for x in example_batch['image']], return_tensors='pt')

    # Don't forget to include the labels!
    inputs['labels'] = example_batch['labels']
    return inputs
```

You can directly apply this to the dataset using `ds.with_transform(transform)`.


```python
prepared_ds = ds.with_transform(transform)
```

Now, whenever you get an example from the dataset, the transform will be 
applied in real time (on both samples and slices, as shown below)


```python
prepared_ds['train'][0:2]
```


This time, the resulting `pixel_values` tensor will have shape `(2, 3, 224, 224)`.

    {
      'pixel_values': tensor([[[[-0.6157, -0.6000, -0.6078,  ..., ]]]]),
      'labels': [0, 0]
    }



# Training and Evaluation

The data is processed and you are ready to start setting up the training pipeline. This blog post uses ü§ó's Trainer, but that'll require us to do a few things first:

- Define a collate function.

- Define an evaluation metric. During training, the model should be evaluated on its prediction accuracy. You should define a `compute_metrics` function accordingly.

- Load a pretrained checkpoint. You need to load a pretrained checkpoint and configure it correctly for training.

- Define the training configuration.

After fine-tuning the model, you will correctly evaluate it on the evaluation data and verify that it has indeed learned to correctly classify the images.

### Define our data collator

Batches are coming in as lists of dicts, so you can just unpack + stack those into batch tensors.

Since the `collate_fn` will return a batch dict, you can `**unpack` the inputs to the model later. ‚ú®


```python
import torch

def collate_fn(batch):
    return {
        'pixel_values': torch.stack([x['pixel_values'] for x in batch]),
        'labels': torch.tensor([x['labels'] for x in batch])
    }
```

### Define an evaluation metric

The [accuracy](https://huggingface.co/metrics/accuracy) metric from `datasets` can easily be used to compare the predictions with the labels. Below, you can see how to use it within a `compute_metrics` function that will be used by the `Trainer`.


```python
import numpy as np
from datasets import load_metric

metric = load_metric("accuracy")
def compute_metrics(p):
    return metric.compute(predictions=np.argmax(p.predictions, axis=1), references=p.label_ids)
```


Let's load the pretrained model. We'll add `num_labels` on init so the model creates a classification head with the right number of units. We'll also include the `id2label` and `label2id` mappings to have human-readable labels in the Hub widget (if you choose to `push_to_hub`).


```python
from transformers import ViTForImageClassification

labels = ds['train'].features['labels'].names

model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained(
    model_name_or_path,
    num_labels=len(labels),
    id2label={str(i): c for i, c in enumerate(labels)},
    label2id={c: str(i) for i, c in enumerate(labels)}
)
```


Almost ready to train! The last thing needed before that is to set up the training configuration by defining [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.16.2/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments).

Most of these are pretty self-explanatory, but one that is quite important here is `remove_unused_columns=False`. This one will drop any features not used by the model's call function. By default it's `True` because usually it's ideal to drop unused feature columns, making it easier to unpack inputs into the model's call function. But, in our case, we need the unused features ('image' in particular) in order to create 'pixel_values'.

What I'm trying to say is that you'll have a bad time if you forget to set `remove_unused_columns=False`.


```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
  output_dir="./vit-base-beans",
  per_device_train_batch_size=16,
  evaluation_strategy="steps",
  num_train_epochs=4,
  fp16=True,
  save_steps=100,
  eval_steps=100,
  logging_steps=10,
  learning_rate=2e-4,
  save_total_limit=2,
  remove_unused_columns=False,
  push_to_hub=False,
  report_to='tensorboard',
  load_best_model_at_end=True,
)
```

Now, all instances can be passed to Trainer and we are ready to start training!


```python
from transformers import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    data_collator=collate_fn,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    train_dataset=prepared_ds["train"],
    eval_dataset=prepared_ds["validation"],
    tokenizer=feature_extractor,
)
```

### Train üöÄ


```python
train_results = trainer.train()
trainer.save_model()
trainer.log_metrics("train", train_results.metrics)
trainer.save_metrics("train", train_results.metrics)
trainer.save_state()
```



### Evaluate üìä

```python
metrics = trainer.evaluate(prepared_ds['validation'])
trainer.log_metrics("eval", metrics)
trainer.save_metrics("eval", metrics)
```

Here were my evaluation results - Cool beans! Sorry, had to say it.

    ***** eval metrics *****
      epoch                   =        4.0
      eval_accuracy           =      0.985
      eval_loss               =     0.0637
      eval_runtime            = 0:00:02.13
      eval_samples_per_second =     62.356
      eval_steps_per_second   =       7.97


Finally, if you want, you can push your model up to the hub. Here, we'll push it up if you specified `push_to_hub=True` in the training configuration. Note that in order to push to hub, you'll have to have git-lfs installed and be logged into your Hugging Face account (which can be done via `huggingface-cli login`).

```python
kwargs = {
    "finetuned_from": model.config._name_or_path,
    "tasks": "image-classification",
    "dataset": 'beans',
    "tags": ['image-classification'],
}

if training_args.push_to_hub:
    trainer.push_to_hub('üçª cheers', **kwargs)
else:
    trainer.create_model_card(**kwargs)
```

The resulting model has been shared to [nateraw/vit-base-beans](https://huggingface.co/nateraw/vit-base-beans). I'm assuming you don't have pictures of bean leaves laying around, so I added some examples for you to give it a try! üöÄ
