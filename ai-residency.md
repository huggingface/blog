# Announcing the ðŸ¤— AI Research Residency Program ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰

<!-- {blog_metadata} -->
<!-- {authors} -->


The ðŸ¤— Research Residency Program is a 9-month opportunity to launch or advance your career in machine learning research ðŸš€. The goal of the residency is to help you grow into an impactful AI researcher. Residents will work alongside Researchers from our Science Team. Together, you will pick a research problem and then develop new machine learning techniques to solve it in an open & collaborative way, with the hope of ultimately publishing your work and making it visible to a wide audience.

Applicants from all backgrounds are welcome! Ideally, you have some research experience and are excited about our mission to democratize responsible machine learning. The progress of our field has the potential to exacerbate existing disparities in ways that disproportionately hurt the most marginalized people in society â€” including people of color, people from working-class backgrounds, women, and LGBTQ+ people. These communities must be centered in the work we do as a research community. So we strongly encourage proposals from people whose personal experience reflects these identities.. We encourage applications relating to AI that demonstrate a clear and positive societal impact.

## How to Apply

Since the focus of your work will be on developing Machine Learning techniques, your application should show evidence of programming skills and of prerequisite courses, like calculus or linear algebra, or links to an open-source project that demonstrates programming and mathematical ability.

More importantly, your application needs to present interest in effecting positive change through AI in any number of creative ways. This can stem from a topic that is of particular interest to you and your proposal would capture concrete ways in which machine learning can contribute. Thinking through the entire pipeline, from understanding where ML tools are needed to gathering data and deploying the resulting approach, can help make your project more impactful.

We are actively working to build a culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusivity. We are intentionally building a workplace where people feel respected and supportedâ€”regardless of who you are or where you come from. We believe this is foundational to building a great company and community. Hugging Face is an equal opportunity employer and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
