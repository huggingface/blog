# ðŸ§¨Â Diffusers welcomes Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large

Stable Diffusion 3.5 is the improved variant of its successor, [Stable Diffusion 3](https://huggingface.co/blog/sd3). 
As of today, the models are available on the Hugging Face Hub and can be used with ðŸ§¨Â Diffusers.

The release comes with [two checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/collections/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-35-671785cca799084f71fa2838):

- A large (8B) model
- A large (8B) timestep-distilled model enabling few-step inference

In this post, we will focus on how to use Stable Diffusion 3.5 (SD3.5) with Diffusers, covering both training and inference.

## Architectural changes
The transformer architecture of SD3.5 (large) is very similar to SD3 (medium) with the following changes:

- QK normalization: For training large transformer models, [QK normalization](https://research.google/blog/scaling-vision-transformers-to-22-billion-parameters/) has now become a standard. SD3.5 Large is no exception to that.
- Dual attention layers: Instead of using single attention layers for each stream of modality in the MMDiT blocks, SD3.5 uses double attention layers.

The rest of the details in terms of the text encoders, VAE, and noise scheduler stay exactly the same as SD3 Medium. For more on SD3, we recommend checking out the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03206).

## Using SD3.5 with Diffusers
Make sure you install the latest version of diffusers:

```bash
pip install -U diffusers
```

As the model is gated, before using it with diffusers, you first need to go to the [Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Hugging Face page](link), fill in the form and accept the gate. 
Once you are in, you need to log in so that your system knows youâ€™ve accepted the gate. Use the command below to log in:
