At Hugging Face, we are contributing to the ecosystem for Deep Reinforcement Learning researchers and enthusiasts. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre happy to announce that we integrated [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) to the Hugging Face Hub.

[CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) is a Deep Reinforcement Learning library that provides high-quality single-file implementation with research-friendly features.
With this integration, you can now host your saved models üíæ and load powerful models from the community.

ADD VIDEO CleanRL

In this article, we‚Äôre going to show how you can do it. But if you want to follow with a tutorial, we wrote one where you'll learn:
- How to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning lander agent to land correctly on the Moon üåï 
- How to upload it to the Hub üöÄ

- How to download and use a saved model from the Hub that CHOOSE ENVIRONMENT

üëâ [The tutorial]() ADD LINK

Sounds exciting? Let's get started!

- [Install the library]()
- [Exploring CleanRL in the Hub]()
- [Uploading models to the Hub]()
- [Loading models from the Hub]()

TODO finish the table des mati√®res when titles are chosen


## What's next?
In the coming weeks and months, we plan on supporting other tools from the ecosystem:

- Integrating [Sample Factory](https://github.com/alex-petrenko/sample-factory) to the Hub.
- Launching the Beta of [Simulate](https://github.com/huggingface/simulate), a library for easily creating and sharing simulation environments for intelligent agents
- Expanding our repository of Decision Transformer models with models trained or finetuned in an online setting [1]

The best way to keep in touch is to¬†**[join our discord server](https://discord.gg/YRAq8fMnUG)**¬†to exchange with us and with the community.

Finally, we would like to thank the ADD COSTA THANKS

### Would you like to integrate your library to the Hub?

This integration is possible thanks to the [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) library which has all our widgets and the API for all our supported libraries. If you would like to integrate your library to the Hub, we have a [guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-adding-libraries) for you!
