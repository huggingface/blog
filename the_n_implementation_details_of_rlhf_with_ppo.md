# The N Implementation Details of RLHF with PPO

RLHF / ChatGPT has been a popular research topic these days. In our quest to research more on RLHF, this blog post attempts to do a reproduction of OpenAI‚Äôs 2019 original RLHF codebase at [*openai/lm-human-preferences*](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences). Despite its ‚Äútensorflow-1.x-ness,‚Äù OpenAI‚Äôs original codebase is very well-evaluated and benchmarked, making it a good place to study RLHF implementation engineering details.

We aim to:

1. reproduce OAI‚Äôs results in stylistic tasks and match the learning curves of [*openai/lm-human-preferences*](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences). 
2. present a checklist of implementation details, similar to the spirit of [*The 37 Implementation Details of Proximal Policy Optimization*](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/); [*Debugging RL, Without the Agonizing Pain*](https://andyljones.com/posts/rl-debugging.html).
3. provide a simple-to-read and minimal reference implementation of RLHF;

This work is just for educational / learning purposes. For advanced users requiring more features, such as running larger models with PEFT, [*huggingface/trl*](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) would be a great choice.

- In [Matching Learning Curves](#matching-learning-curves), we show our main contribution: creating a codebase that can reproduce OAI‚Äôs results in the stylistic tasks and matching learning curves very closely with [*openai/lm-human-preferences*](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences).
- We then take a technical deep dive into the implementation details that are relevant to reproducing OAI‚Äôs work. In [General Implementation Details](#general-implementation-details), we talk about basic details, such as how rewards/values are generated and how responses are generated. In [Reward Model Implementation Details](#reward-model-implementation-details), we talk about details such as reward normalization. In [Policy Training Implementation Details](#policy-training-implementation-details), we discuss details such as rejection sampling and reward ‚Äúwhitening‚Äù.
    - In [**PyTorch Adam optimizer numerical issues w.r.t RLHF**](#pytorch-adam-optimizer-numerical-issues-wrt-rlhf), we highlight a very interesting implementation difference in Adam between TensorFlow and PyTorch, which causes an aggressive update in the model training.
- Next, we examine the effect of training different base models (e.g., gpt2-xl, falcon-1b,) given that the reward labels are produced with `gpt2-large`.
- Finally, we conclude our work with limitations and discussions.

# Matching Learning Curves

Our main contribution is to reproduce OAI‚Äôs results in stylistic tasks, such as sentiment and descriptiveness. As shown in the figure below, our codebase (orange curves) can produce nearly identical learning curves as OAI‚Äôs codebase (blue curves).

## A note on running openai/lm-human-preferences

To make a direct comparison, we ran the original RLHF code at [*openai/lm-human-preferences*](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences), which will offer valuable metrics to help validate and diagnose our reproduction. We were able to set the original TensorFlow 1.x code up, but it requires a hyper-specific setup:

- OAI‚Äôs dataset was partially corrupted/lost (so we replaced them with similar HF datasets, which may or may not cause a performance difference)
    - Specifically, its book dataset was lost during OpenAI‚Äôs GCP - Azure migration ([https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/issues/17#issuecomment-1044051496](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/issues/17#issuecomment-1044051496)). I replaced the book dataset with Hugging Face‚Äôs `bookcorpus` dataset, which is, in principle, what OAI used.
- It can‚Äôt run on 1 V100 because it doesn‚Äôt implement gradient accumulation. Instead, it uses a large batch size and splits the batch across 8 GPUs, and will OOM on just 1 GPU.
- It can‚Äôt run on 8x A100 because it uses TensorFlow 1.x, which is incompatible with Cuda 8+
- It can‚Äôt run on 8x V100 (16GB) because it will OOM
- It can only run on 8x V100 (32GB), which is only offered by AWS as the `p3dn.24xlarge` instance.

# General Implementation Details

We now take a technical deep dive into the implementation details that are relevant to reproducing OAI‚Äôs work. In this section, we talk about basic details, such as how rewards/values are generated and how responses are generated. Here are these details in no particular order:

1. **The reward model and policy‚Äôs value head take input as the concatenation of `query` and `response`**
    1. The reward model and policy‚Äôs value head do *not* only look at the response. Instead, it concatenates the `query` and `response` together as `query_response` ([lm_human_preferences/rewards.py#L105-L107](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/rewards.py#L105-L107)).
    2. So, for example, if `query = "he was quiet for a minute, his eyes unreadable"`., and the `response = "He looked at his left hand, which held the arm that held his arm out in front of him."`, then the reward model and policy‚Äôs value do a forward pass on `query_response = "he was quiet for a minute, his eyes unreadable. He looked at his left hand, which held the arm that held his arm out in front of him."` and produced rewards and values of shape `(B, T, 1)`, where `B` is the batch size, `T` is the sequence length, and `1` is the reward head dimension of 1 ([lm_human_preferences/rewards.py#L105-L107](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/rewards.py#L105-L107), [lm_human_preferences/policy.py#L111](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/policy.py#L111)). 
    3. The `T` means that each token has a reward associated with it and its previous context. For example, the `eyes` token would have a reward corresponding to `he was quiet for a minute, his eyes`.
2. **Pad with a special padding token and truncate inputs.** 
    1. OAI sets a fixed input length for query `query_length`; it **pads** sequences that are too short with `pad_token` ([lm_human_preferences/language/datasets.py#L66-L67](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/datasets.py#L66-L67)) and **truncates** sequences that are too long ([lm_human_preferences/language/datasets.py#L57](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/datasets.py#L57)). See [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pad_truncation) for a general introduction to the concept). When padding the inputs, OAI uses a token beyond the vocabulary ([lm_human_preferences/language/encodings.py#L56](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/encodings.py#L56)).
        1. **Note on HF‚Äôs transformers ‚Äî padding token.** According to  ([transformers#2630#issuecomment-578159876](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/2630#issuecomment-578159876)), padding tokens were not used during the pre-training of GPT and GPT-2; therefore transformer‚Äôs gpt2 models have no official padding token associated with its tokenizer. A common practice is to set `tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token`, but in this work, we shall distinguish these two special tokens to match OAI‚Äôs original setting, so we will use `tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"pad_token": "[PAD]"})`. 
        
        Note that having no padding token is a default setting for decoder models, since they train with ‚Äúpacking‚Äù during pretraining, which means that many sequences are concatenated and separated by the EOS token and chunks of this sequence that always have the max length are fed to the model during pretraining.
    2. When putting everything together, here is an example
    
    ```python
    import transformers
    tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2", padding_side="right")
    tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"pad_token": "[PAD]"})
    query_length = 5
    texts = [
    	"usually, he would",
    	"she thought about it",
    ]    
    tokens = []
    for text in texts:
        tokens.append(tokenizer.encode(text)[:query_length])
    
    print("tokens", tokens)
    inputs = tokenizer.pad(
        {"input_ids": tokens},
        padding="max_length",
        max_length=query_length,
        return_tensors="pt",
        return_attention_mask=True,
    )
    print("inputs", inputs)
    
    """prints are
    tokens [[23073, 11, 339, 561], [7091, 1807, 546, 340]]
    inputs {'input_ids': tensor([[23073,    11,   339,   561, 50257],
            [ 7091,  1807,   546,   340, 50257]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]])}
    """
    ```
    
3. **Adjust position indices correspondingly for padding tokens**
    1. When calculating the logits, OAI‚Äôs code works by masking out padding tokens properly. This is achieved by finding out the token indices corresponding to the padding tokens ([lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L296-L297](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L296-L297)), followed by adjusting their position indices correspondingly ([lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L320](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L320)).
    2. For example, if the `query=[23073, 50259, 50259]` and `response=[11, 339, 561]`, where (`50259` is OAI‚Äôs padding token), it then creates position indices as `[[0 1 1 1 2 3]]` and logits as follows. Note how the logits corresponding to the padding tokens remain the same as before! This is the effect we should be aiming for in our reproduction.
        
        ```python
        all_logits [[[ -35.28693   -34.2875    -38.16074  ...  -41.595802  -41.082108
            -35.36577 ]
          [ -35.28693   -34.2875    -38.16074  ...  -41.595802  -41.082108
            -35.36577 ]
          [ -35.28693   -34.2875    -38.16074  ...  -41.595802  -41.082108
            -35.36577 ]
          [-111.303955 -110.94471  -112.90624  ... -113.13064  -113.7788
           -109.17345 ]
          [-111.51512  -109.61077  -114.90231  ... -118.43514  -111.56671
           -112.12478 ]
          [-122.69775  -121.84468  -128.27417  ... -132.28055  -130.39604
           -125.707756]]] (1, 6, 50257)
        ```
        
    3. **Note on HF‚Äôs transformers ‚Äî `position_ids` and `padding_side`.** We can replicate the exact logits using Hugging Face‚Äôs transformer with 1) left padding and 2) pass in the appropriate `position_ids`:
        
        ```python
        import torch
        import transformers
        tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2", padding_side="right")
        tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"pad_token": "[PAD]"})
        pad_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id
        query = torch.tensor([
            [pad_id, pad_id, 23073],
        ])
        response = torch.tensor([
            [11, 339, 561],
        ])
        temperature = 1.0
        
        query = torch.tensor(query)
        response = torch.tensor(response).long()
        context_length = query.shape[1]
        query_response = torch.cat((query, response), 1)
        pretrained_model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
        def forward(policy, query_responses, tokenizer):
            attention_mask = query_responses != tokenizer.pad_token_id
            position_ids = attention_mask.cumsum(1) - attention_mask.long()  # exclusive cumsum
            input_ids = query_responses.clone()
            input_ids[~attention_mask] = 0
            return policy(
                input_ids=input_ids,
                attention_mask=attention_mask,
                position_ids=position_ids,
                return_dict=True,
                output_hidden_states=True,
            )
        output = forward(pretrained_model, query_response, tokenizer)
        logits = output.logits
        logits /= temperature
        print(logits)
        
        """
        tensor([[[ -26.9395,  -26.4709,  -30.0456,  ...,  -33.2208,  -33.2884,
                   -27.4360],
                 [ -27.1677,  -26.7330,  -30.2386,  ...,  -33.6813,  -33.6931,
                   -27.5928],
                 [ -35.2869,  -34.2875,  -38.1608,  ...,  -41.5958,  -41.0821,

                 [-111.3040, -110.9447, -112.9062,  ..., -113.1306, -113.7788,

                  -125.7078]]], grad_fn=<DivBackward0>)
        """
        ```
        
    4. **Note on HF‚Äôs transformers ‚Äî `position_ids` during `generate`:** during generate we should not pass in `position_ids` because the `position_ids` are already adjusted in `transformers` somehow. When I also pass in `position_ids` in the generation, the performance catastrophically deteriorates. 
    
    Usually, we almost never pass `position_ids` in transformers. All the masking and shifting logic are already implemented e.g. in the `generate` function (need permanent code link).
4. **Response generation samples a fixed-length response without padding.**
    1. During response generation, OAI uses `top_k=0, top_p=1.0` and just do categorical samples across the vocabulary  ([lm_human_preferences/language/sample.py#L43](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/sample.py#L43)) and the code would keep sampling until a fixed-length response is generated ([lm_human_preferences/policy.py#L103](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/policy.py#L103)). Notably, even if it encounters EOS (end-of-sequence) tokens, it will keep sampling.
    2. **Note on HF‚Äôs transformers ‚Äî sampling could stop at `eos_token`:** in `transformers`, the generation could stop at `eos_token` ([src/transformers/generation/utils.py#L2248-L2256](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/67b85f24def79962ce075353c2627f78e0e53e9f/src/transformers/generation/utils.py#L2248-L2256)), which is not the same as OAI‚Äôs setting. To align the setting, we need to do set `pretrained_model.generation_config.eos_token_id = None, pretrained_model.generation_config.pad_token_id = None`. Note that `transformers.GenerationConfig(eos_token_id=None, pad_token_id=None, ...)` does not work because `pretrained_model.generation_config` would override and set a `eos_token`.
        
        ```python
        import torch
        import transformers
        tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2", padding_side="right")
        tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"pad_token": "[PAD]"})
        pad_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id
        query = torch.tensor([
            [pad_id, pad_id, 23073],
        ])
        response = torch.tensor([
            [11, 339, 561],
        ])
        response_length = 4
        temperature = 0.7
        pretrained_model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
        pretrained_model.generation_config.eos_token_id = None # disable `pad_token_id` and `eos_token_id` because we just want to
        pretrained_model.generation_config.pad_token_id = None  # generate tokens without truncation / padding
        generation_config = transformers.GenerationConfig(
            max_new_tokens=response_length,
            min_new_tokens=response_length,
            temperature=temperature,
            top_k=0.0,
            top_p=1.0,
            do_sample=True,
        )
        context_length = query.shape[1]
        attention_mask = query != tokenizer.pad_token_id
        input_ids = query.clone()
        input_ids[~attention_mask] = 0  # set padding tokens to 0
        output = pretrained_model.generate(
            input_ids=input_ids,
            attention_mask=attention_mask,
            # position_ids=attention_mask.cumsum(1) - attention_mask.long(), # generation collapsed if this was turned on.
            generation_config=generation_config,
            return_dict_in_generate=True,
        )
        print(output.sequences)
        
        """
        tensor([[    0,     0, 23073, 16851,    11,   475,   991]])
        """
        ```
        
    3. Note that in a more recent codebase https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback, OAI does stop sampling when encountering EOS token ([summarize_from_feedback/utils/experiment_helpers.py#L19](https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback/blob/8af822a428c93432aa80ffbe5b065a8f93895669/summarize_from_feedback/utils/experiment_helpers.py#L19)). However in this work we aim to do a 1:1 replication, so we align the setting that could keep sampling even eos_token is encountered 
5. **Learning rate annealing for reward model and policy training.**
    1. As Ziegler et al. (2019) suggested, the reward model is trained for a single epoch to avoid overfitting the limited amount of human annotation data (e.g., the `descriptiveness` task only had about 5000 labels). During this single epoch, the learning rate is annealed to zero ([lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L249](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L249)).
    2. Similar to reward model training, the learning rate is annealed to zero ([lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L172-L173](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L172-L173)).
6. **Use different seeds for different processes**
    1. When spawning 8 GPU processes to do data parallelism, OAI sets a different random seed per process ([lm_human_preferences/utils/core.py#L108-L111](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/utils/core.py#L108-L111)). Implementation-wise, this is done via `local_seed = args.seed + process_rank * 100003`. The seed is going to make the model produce different responses and get different scores, for example.
        1. Note: I believe the dataset shuffling has a bug ‚Äî the dataset is shuffled using the same seed for some reason ([lm_human_preferences/lm_tasks.py#L94-L97](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/lm_tasks.py#L94-L97)).

# Reward Model Implementation Details

In this section, we discuss reward-model-specific implementation details. We talk about details such as reward normalization and layer initialization. Here are these details in no particular order:

1. **The reward model only outputs the value at the last token.**
    1. Notice that the rewards obtained after the forward pass on the concatenation of `query` and `response` will have the shape `(B, T, 1)`, where `B` is the batch size, `T` is the sequence length (which is always the same; it is `query_length + response_length = 64 + 24 = 88` in OAI‚Äôs setting for stylistic tasks, see [launch.py#L9-L11](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/launch.py#L9-L11)), and `1` is the reward head dimension of 1.  For RLHF purposes, the original codebase extracts the reward of the last token ([lm_human_preferences/rewards.py#L132](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/rewards.py#L132)), so that the rewards will only have shape `(B, 1)`. 
    2. Note that in a more recent codebase [*openai/summarize-from-feedback*](https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback), OAI stops sampling when encountering EOS token ([summarize_from_feedback/utils/experiment_helpers.py#L19](https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback/blob/8af822a428c93432aa80ffbe5b065a8f93895669/summarize_from_feedback/utils/experiment_helpers.py#L19)). When extracting rewards, it is going to identify the `last_response_index`, the index before the EOS token ([#L11-L13](https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback/blob/8af822a428c93432aa80ffbe5b065a8f93895669/summarize_from_feedback/reward_model.py#L11-L13)), and extract the reward at that index ([summarize_from_feedback/reward_model.py#L59](https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback/blob/8af822a428c93432aa80ffbe5b065a8f93895669/summarize_from_feedback/reward_model.py#L59)). However in this work we just stick with the original setting.
2. **Reward head layer initialization**
    1. The weight of the reward head is initialized according to \\( \mathcal{N}\left(0,1 /\left(\sqrt{d_{\text {model }}+1}\right)\right) \\) ([lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L368,](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L368) [lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L251-L252](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L251-L252)). This aligns with the settings in  Stiennon et al., 2020 ([summarize_from_feedback/query_response_model.py#L106-L107](https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback/blob/8af822a428c93432aa80ffbe5b065a8f93895669/summarize_from_feedback/query_response_model.py#L106-L107)) (P.S., Stiennon et al., 2020 had a typo on page 17 saying the distribution is  \\( \mathcal{N}\left(0,1 /\left(d_{\text {model }}+1\right)\right) \\) without the square root)
    2. The bias of the reward head is set to 0 ([lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L254](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L254)).
3. **Reward model normalization before and after**
    1. In the paper, Ziegler el al. (2019) mentioned that "to keep the scale of the reward model consistent across training, we normalize it so that it has mean 0 and variance 1 for \\( x \sim \mathcal{D}, y \sim \rho(¬∑|x) \\).‚Äù To perform the normalization process, the code first creates a `reward_gain` and `reward_bias`, such that the reward can be calculated by `reward = reward * reward_gain + reward_bias` ([lm_human_preferences/rewards.py#L50-L51](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/rewards.py#L50-L51)). 
    2. When performing the normalization process, the code first sets `reward_gain=1, reward_bias=0` ([lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L211](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L211)), followed by collecting sampled queries from the target dataset (e.g., `bookcorpus, tldr, cnndm`), completed responses, and evaluated rewards. It then gets the **empirical mean and std** of the evaluated reward ([lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L162-L167](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L162-L167)) and tries to compute what the `reward_gain` and `reward_bias` should be. 
    3. Let us use \\( \mu_{\mathcal{D}} \\) to denote the empirical mean, \\( \sigma_{\mathcal{D}} \\) the empirical std, \\(g\\) the `reward_gain`, \\(b\\) `reward_bias`,  \\( \mu_{\mathcal{T}} = 0\\) **target mean** and \\( \sigma_{\mathcal{T}}=1\\) **target std**. Then we have the following formula. 
$$\begin{aligned}g*\mathcal{N}(\mu_{\mathcal{D}}, \sigma_{\mathcal{D}}) + b &= \mathcal{N}(g*\mu_{\mathcal{D}}, g*\sigma_{\mathcal{D}}) + b\\&= \mathcal{N}(g*\mu_{\mathcal{D}} + b, g*\sigma_{\mathcal{D}}) \\&= \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\mathcal{T}}, \sigma_{\mathcal{T}}) \\g &= \frac{\sigma_{\mathcal{T}}}{\sigma_{\mathcal{D}}} \\b &= \mu_{\mathcal{T}} - g*\mu_{\mathcal{D}}\end{aligned}$$
    4. The normalization process is then applied **before** and **after** reward model training ([lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L232-L234](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L232-L234), [lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L252-L254](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L252-L254)).
    5. Note that responses  \\( y \sim \rho(¬∑|x) \\) we generated for the normalization purpose are from the pre-trained language model \\(\rho \\). The model \\(\rho \\)  is fixed as a reference and is not updated in reward learning ([lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L286C1-L286C31](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/master/lm_human_preferences/train_reward.py#L286C1-L286C31)). 
        


# Policy Training Implementation Details

In this section, we will delve into details, such as layer initialization, data post-processing, and dropout settings. We will also explore techniques, such as of rejection sampling and reward "whitening", and adaptive KL. Here are these details in no particular order:

1. **Scale the logits by sampling temperature.** 
    1. When calculating the log probability of responses, the model first outputs the logits of the tokens in the responses, followed by dividing the logits with the sampling temperature ([lm_human_preferences/policy.py#L121](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/policy.py#L121)). I.e., `logits /= self.temperature`
    2. In an informal test, we found that without this scaling, the KL would rise faster than expected, and performance would deteriorate.
2. **Value head layer initialization**
    1. The weight of the value head is initialized according to \\(\mathcal{N}\left(0,0\right)\\) ([lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L368,](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L368) [lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L251-L252](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L251-L252)). This is 
    2. The bias of the reward head is set to 0 ([lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L254](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/model.py#L254)).
3. **Select query texts that start and end with a period**
    1. This is done as part of the data preprocessing;
        1. Tries to select text only after `start_text="."` ([lm_human_preferences/language/datasets.py#L51](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/datasets.py#L51))
        2. Tries select text just before `end_text="."` ([lm_human_preferences/language/datasets.py#L61](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/datasets.py#L61))
        3. Then pad the text ([lm_human_preferences/language/datasets.py#L66-L67](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/language/datasets.py#L66-L67))
    2. When running `openai/lm-human-preferences`, OAI‚Äôs datasets were partially corrupted/lost ([openai/lm-human-preferences/issues/17#issuecomment-104405149](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/issues/17#issuecomment-1044051496)), so we had to replace them with similar HF datasets, which may or may not cause a performance difference) 
    3. For the book dataset, we used [https://huggingface.co/datasets/bookcorpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bookcorpus), which we find not necessary to extract sentences that start and end with periods because the dataset ) is already pre-processed this way (e.g., `"usually , he would be tearing around the living room , playing with his toys ."`) To this end, we set `start_text=None, end_text=None` for the `sentiment` and `descriptiveness` tasks. 
4. **Disable dropout**
    1. Ziegler et al. (2019) suggested, ‚ÄúWe do not use dropout for policy training.‚Äù This is also done in the code ([lm_human_preferences/policy.py#L48](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/policy.py#L48)).
5. **Rejection sampling** 
    1. Ziegler et al. (2019) suggested, ‚ÄúWe use rejection sampling to ensure there is a period between tokens 16 and 24 and then truncate at that period (This is a crude approximation for ‚Äòend of sentence.‚Äô We chose it because it is easy to integrate into the RL loop, and even a crude approximation is sufficient for the intended purpose of making the human evaluation task somewhat easier). During the RL finetuning, we penalize continuations that don‚Äôt have such a period by giving them a fixed reward of ‚àí1.‚Äù
    2. Specifically, this is achieved with the following steps:
        1. **Token truncation**: We want to truncate at the first occurrence of `truncate_token` that appears at or after position `truncate_after` in the responses ([lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L378](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L378))
            1. Code comment: ‚Äúcentral example: replace all tokens after truncate_token with padding_token‚Äù
        2. **Run reward model on truncated response:** After the response has been truncated by the token truncation process, the code then runs the reward model on the **truncated response**.
        3. **Rejection sampling**: if there is not a period between tokens 16 and 24, then replace the score of the response with a fixed low value (such as -1)([lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L384](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L384), [lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L384-L402](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L384-L402))
            1. Code comment: ‚Äúcentral example: ensure that the sample contains `truncate_token`"
            2. Code comment:  ‚Äúonly query humans on responses that pass that function‚Äú
        4. To give some examples in `descriptiveness`:
            
            ![Samples extracted from our reproduction [https://wandb.ai/openrlbenchmark/lm_human_preference_details/runs/djf8yymv/logs](https://wandb.ai/openrlbenchmark/lm_human_preference_details/runs/djf8yymv/logs?workspace=user-costa-huang). Notice the 1st and 3rd example has too many tokens after the period, so its score was replaced by -1. ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-internal-testing/example-images/resolve/main/rlhf_implementation_details/Untitled%201.png)
            
            Samples extracted from our reproduction [https://wandb.ai/openrlbenchmark/lm_human_preference_details/runs/djf8yymv/logs](https://wandb.ai/openrlbenchmark/lm_human_preference_details/runs/djf8yymv/logs?workspace=user-costa-huang). Notice the 1st and 3rd example has too many tokens after the period, so its score was replaced by -1. 
            
6. **Discount factor = 1**
    1. The discount parameter \\(\gamma\\) is set to 1 ([lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L56](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L56)), which means that future rewards are given the same weight as immediate rewards.
7. **Terminology of the training loop: batches and minibatches in PPO**
    1. OAI uses the following training loop ([lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L184-L192](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L184-L192)). Note: we additionally added the `micro_batch_size` to help deal with the case in gradient accumulation. At each epoch, it shuffles the batch indices.
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        batch_size = 8
        nminibatches = 2
        gradient_accumulation_steps = 2
        mini_batch_size = batch_size // nminibatches
        micro_batch_size = mini_batch_size // gradient_accumulation_steps
        data = np.arange(batch_size).astype(np.float32)
        print("data:", data)
        print("batch_size:", batch_size)
        print("mini_batch_size:", mini_batch_size)
        print("micro_batch_size:", micro_batch_size)
        for epoch in range(4):
            batch_inds = np.random.permutation(batch_size)
            print("epoch:", epoch, "batch_inds:", batch_inds)
            for mini_batch_start in range(0, batch_size, mini_batch_size):
                mini_batch_end = mini_batch_start + mini_batch_size
                mini_batch_inds = batch_inds[mini_batch_start:mini_batch_end]
                
                # `optimizer.zero_grad()` set optimizer to zero for gradient accumulation
                for micro_batch_start in range(0, mini_batch_size, micro_batch_size):
                    micro_batch_end = micro_batch_start + micro_batch_size 
                    micro_batch_inds = mini_batch_inds[micro_batch_start:micro_batch_end]
                    print("____‚è© a forward pass on", data[micro_batch_inds])
                # `optimizer.step()`
                print("‚è™ a backward pass on", data[mini_batch_inds])
        
        # data: [0. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.]
        # batch_size: 8
        # mini_batch_size: 4

        # ‚è™ a backward pass on [3. 0. 6. 5.]
        ```
        
8. **Per-token KL penalty**
    - The code adds a per-token KL penalty ([lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L150-L153](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L150-L153)) to the rewards, in order to discourage the policy to be very different from the original¬†policy.
    - Using the `"usually, he would"` as an example, it gets tokenized to `[23073, 11, 339, 561]`. Say we use `[23073]` as the query and `[11, 339, 561]` as the response. Then under the default `gpt2` parameters, the response tokens will have log probabilities of the reference policy `logprobs=[-3.3213, -4.9980, -3.8690]` .
        - During the first PPO update epoch and minibatch update, so the active policy will have the same log probabilities `new_logprobs=[-3.3213, -4.9980, -3.8690]`. , so the per-token KL penalty would be  `kl = new_logprobs - logprobs = [0., 0., 0.,]`
        - However, after the first gradient backward pass, we could have `new_logprob=[3.3213, -4.9980, -3.8690]` , so the per-token KL penalty becomes `kl = new_logprobs - logprobs = [-0.3315, -0.0426, 0.6351]`
        - Then the `non_score_reward = beta * kl` , where `beta` is the KL penalty coefficient  \\(\beta\\), and it‚Äôs added to the `score` obtained from the reward model to create the `rewards` used for training. The `score` is only given at the end of episode; it could look like `[0.4,]` , and we have `rewards = [beta * -0.3315, beta * -0.0426, beta * 0.6351 + 0.4]`.
9. **Per-minibatch reward and advantage whitening, with optional mean shifting**
    1. OAI implements a `whiten` function that looks like below, basically normalizing the `values` by subtracting its mean followed by dividing by its standard deviation. Optionally, `whiten` can shift back the mean of the whitened `values` with `shift_mean=True`. 
    
    ```python
    def whiten(values, shift_mean=True):
        mean, var = torch.mean(values), torch.var(values, unbiased=False)
        whitened = (values - mean) * torch.rsqrt(var + 1e-8)
        if not shift_mean:
            whitened += mean
        return whitened
    ```
    
    1. In each minibatch, OAI then whitens the reward `whiten(rewards, shift_mean=False)` without shifting the mean ([lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L325](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L325)) and whitens the advantages `whiten(advantages)` with the shifted mean ([lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L338](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L338)).
    2. **Optimization note:** if the number of minibatches is one (which is the case in this reproduction) we only need to whiten rewards, calculate and whiten advantages once since their values won‚Äôt change.
    3. **TensorFlow vs PyTorch note:** Different behavior of `tf.moments` vs `torch.var`: The behavior of whitening is different in torch vs tf because the variance calculation is different: 
        
        ```jsx
        import numpy as np
        import tensorflow as tf
        import torch
        
        def whiten_tf(values, shift_mean=True):
            mean, var = tf.nn.moments(values, axes=list(range(values.shape.rank)))
            mean = tf.Print(mean, [mean], 'mean', summarize=100)
            var = tf.Print(var, [var], 'var', summarize=100)
            whitened = (values - mean) * tf.rsqrt(var + 1e-8)
            if not shift_mean:
                whitened += mean
            return whitened
        
        def whiten_pt(values, shift_mean=True, unbiased=True):

10. **Clipped value function**
    1. As done in the original PPO ([baselines/ppo2/model.py#L68-L75](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/ea25b9e8b234e6ee1bca43083f8f3cf974143998/baselines/ppo2/model.py#L68-L75)), the value function is clipped ([lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L343-L348](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L343-L348)) in a similar fashion as the policy objective. 
11. **Adaptive KL**
    - The KL divergence penalty coefficient \\(\beta\\) is modified adaptively based on the KL divergence between the current policy and the previous policy. If the KL divergence is outside a predefined target range, the penalty coefficient is adjusted to bring it closer to the target range ([lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L115-L124](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences/blob/cbfd210bb8b08f6bc5c26878c10984b90f516c66/lm_human_preferences/train_policy.py#L115-L124)). It‚Äôs implemented as follows:
        
        ```python
        class AdaptiveKLController:
            def __init__(self, init_kl_coef, hparams):
                self.value = init_kl_coef
                self.hparams = hparams
        
            def update(self, current, n_steps):
                target = self.hparams.target
                proportional_error = np.clip(current / target - 1, -0.2, 0.2)
                mult = 1 + proportional_error * n_steps / self.hparams.horizon
                self.value *= mult
        ```
        
    - For the `sentiment` and `descriptiveness` tasks examined in this work, we have `init_kl_coef=0.15, hparams.target=6, hparams.horizon=10000`.

## **PyTorch Adam optimizer numerical issues w.r.t RLHF**

- This implementation detail is so interesting that it deserves a full section.
- PyTorch Adam optimizer ([torch.optim.Adam.html](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.Adam.html)) has a different implementation compared to TensorFlow‚Äôs Adam optimizer (TF1 Adam at [tensorflow/v1.15.2/adam.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v1.15.2/tensorflow/python/training/adam.py), TF2 Adam at [keras/adam.py#L26-L220](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/v2.13.1/keras/optimizers/adam.py#L26-L220)). In particular, **PyTorch follows Algorithm 1** of the Kingma and Ba‚Äôs Adam paper ([arxiv/1412.6980](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf)), but **TensorFlow uses the formulation just before Section 2.1** of the paper and its `epsilon` referred to here is `epsilon hat` in the paper. In a pseudocode comparison, we have the following

```python
### pytorch adam implementation:
bias_correction1 = 1 - beta1 ** step
bias_correction2 = 1 - beta2 ** step
step_size = lr / bias_correction1
bias_correction2_sqrt = _dispatch_sqrt(bias_correction2)
denom = (exp_avg_sq.sqrt() / bias_correction2_sqrt).add_(eps)
param.addcdiv_(exp_avg, denom, value=-step_size)

### tensorflow adam implementation:
lr_t = lr * _dispatch_sqrt((1 - beta2 ** step)) / (1 - beta1 ** step)
denom = exp_avg_sq.sqrt().add_(eps)
param.addcdiv_(exp_avg, denom, value=-lr_t)
```

- Let‚Äôs compare the update equations of pytorch-style and tensorflow-style adam. Following the notation of the adam paper [(Kingma and Ba, 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980),  we have the gradient update rules for pytorch adam (Algorithm 1 of Kingma and Ba‚Äôs paper) and tensorflow-style adam (the formulation just before Section 2.1 of Kingma and Ba‚Äôs paper) as below:

$$\begin{aligned}\text{pytorch adam :}\quad \theta_t & =\theta_{t-1}-\alpha \cdot \hat{m}_t /\left(\sqrt{\hat{v}_t}+\varepsilon\right) \\& =\theta_{t-1}- \alpha \underbrace{\left[m_t /\left(1-\beta_1^t\right)\right]}_{=\hat{m}_t} /\left[\sqrt{\underbrace{v_t /\left(1-\beta_2^t\right)}_{=\hat{v}_t} }+\varepsilon\right]\\& =\theta_{t-1}- \alpha\left[m_t /\left(1-\beta_1^t\right)\right]\frac{\sqrt{1-\beta_2^t}}{\sqrt{v_t}+\color{green}{\varepsilon \sqrt{1-\beta_2^t}}}\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}\text{tensorflow adam:}\quad \theta_t & =\theta_{t-1}-\alpha_t m_t /\left(\sqrt{v_t}+\hat{\varepsilon}\right) \\& =\theta_{t-1}-\underbrace{\left[\alpha \sqrt{1-\beta_2^t} /\left(1-\beta_1^t\right)\right]}_{=\alpha_t} m_t /\left(\sqrt{v_t}+\hat{\varepsilon}\right) \\& =\theta_{t-1}- \alpha\left[m_t /\left(1-\beta_1^t\right)\right] \frac{\sqrt{1-\beta_2^t}}{\sqrt{v_t}+\color{green}{\hat{\varepsilon}}} \end{aligned}$$


- The equations above highlight that the distinction between pytorch and tensorflow implementation is their **normalization terms**, \\(\color{green}{\varepsilon \sqrt{1-\beta_2^t}}\\)  and \\(\color{green}{\hat{\varepsilon}}\\). The two versions are equivalent if we set  \\(\hat{\varepsilon}  =\varepsilon \sqrt{1-\beta_2^t}\\) .  However, in the pytorch and tensorflow APIs, we can only set \\(\varepsilon\\) (pytorch) and \\(\hat{\varepsilon}\\) (tensorflow) via the `eps` argument, causing differences in their update equations. What if we set  \\(\varepsilon\\) and \\(\hat{\varepsilon}\\)  to the same value, say, 1e-5? Then for tensorflow adam, the normalization term \\(\hat{\varepsilon} = \text{1e-5}\\)  is just a constant. But for pytorch adam, the normalization term \\({\varepsilon \sqrt{1-\beta_2^t}}\\) changes over time. Importantly, initially much smaller than 1e-5 when the timestep \\(t\\) is small, the term  \\({\varepsilon \sqrt{1-\beta_2^t}}\\)  gradually approaches to 1e-5 as timesteps increase. The plot below compares these two normalization terms over timesteps:
    
    ![norma_const_comparison.png](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-internal-testing/example-images/resolve/main/rlhf_implementation_details/norma_const_comparison.png)
    
- The above figure shows that, if we set the same `eps` in pytorch adam and tensorflow adam, then pytorch-adam uses a much smaller normalization term than tensorflow-adam in the early phase of training. In other words, pytorch adam goes for **more aggressive gradient updates early in the training**. Our experiments support this finding, as we will demonstrate below.
- How does this impact reproducibility and performance? To align settings, we record the original query, response, and rewards from [https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences) and save them in [https://huggingface.co/datasets/vwxyzjn/lm-human-preferences-debug/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vwxyzjn/lm-human-preferences-debug/tree/main). I also record the metrics of the first two epochs of training with TF1‚Äôs `AdamOptimizer` optimizer as the ground truth.  Below are some key metrics:
    
    
    |  | OAI‚Äôs TF1 Adam | PyTorch‚Äôs Adam | Our custom Tensorflow-style Adam |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | policy/approxkl | 0.00037167023 | 0.0023672834504395723 | 0.000374998344341293 |
    | policy/clipfrac | 0.0045572915 | 0.02018229104578495 | 0.0052083334885537624 |
    | ratio_mean | 1.0051285 | 1.0105520486831665 | 1.0044583082199097 |

    | ratio_min | 0.7400441 | 0.4011387825012207 | 0.7299948930740356 |
    | logprob_diff_mean | 0.0047487603 | 0.008101251907646656 | 0.004073789343237877 |
    | logprob_diff_var | 0.0007207897 | 0.004668936599045992 | 0.0007334011606872082 |
    | logprob_diff_max | 0.20474821 | 0.594489574432373 | 0.22331619262695312 |
    | logprob_diff_min | -0.30104542 | -0.9134478569030762 | -0.31471776962280273 |
- **PyTorch‚Äôs `Adam` produces a more aggressive update** for some reason. Here are some evidence:
    - **PyTorch‚Äôs `Adam`'s `logprob_diff_var`** **is 6x higher**. Here `logprobs_diff = new_logprobs - logprobs` is the difference between the log probability of tokens between the initial and current policy after two epochs of training. Having a larger `logprob_diff_var` means the scale of the log probability changes is larger than that in OAI‚Äôs TF1 Adam.
    - **PyTorch‚Äôs `Adam` presents a more extreme ratio max and min.** Here `ratio = torch.exp(logprobs_diff)`. Having a `ratio_max=1.8121057748794556` means that for some token, the probability of sampling that token is 1.8x more likely under the current policy, as opposed to only 1.2x with OAI‚Äôs TF1 Adam.
    - **Larger `policy/approxkl` `policy/clipfrac`.** Because of the aggressive update, the ratio gets clipped **4.4x more often, and the approximate KL divergence is 6x larger.**
    - The aggressive update is likely gonna cause further issues. E.g.,¬†¬†`logprob_diff_mean`¬†is 1.7x larger in PyTorch‚Äôs¬†`Adam`, which would correspond to 1.7x larger KL penalty in the next reward calculation; this could get compounded. In fact, this might be related to the famous KL divergence issue ‚Äî KL penalty is much larger than it should be and the model could pay more attention and optimizes for it more instead, therefore causing negative KL divergence.
- **Larger models get affected more.** We conducted experiments comparing PyTorch‚Äôs `Adam` (codename `pt_adam`) and our custom TensorFlow-style (codename `tf_adam`) with `gpt2` and `gpt2-xl`. We found that the performance are roughly similar under `gpt2`; however with `gpt2-xl`, we observed a more aggressive updates, meaning that larger models get affected by this issue more.
    - When the initial policy updates are more aggressive in `gpt2-xl`, the training dynamics get affected. For example, we see a much larger `objective/kl` and `objective/scores` spikes with `pt_adam`, especially with `sentiment` ‚Äî *the biggest KL was as large as 17.5* in one of the random seeds, suggesting an undesirable over-optimization.
    - Furthermore, because of the larger KL, many other training metrics are affected as well. For example, we see a much larger `clipfrac` (the fraction of time the `ratio` gets clipped by PPO‚Äôs objective clip coefficient 0.2) and `approxkl`.

# Limitations

Noticed this work does not try to reproduce the summarization work in CNN DM or TL;DR. This was because we found the training to be time-consuming and brittle. 

The particular training run we had showed poor GPU utilization (around 30%), so it takes almost 4 days to perform a training run, which is highly expensive (only AWS sells p3dn.24xlarge, and it costs $31.212 per hour)

Additionally, training was brittle. While the reward goes up, we find it difficult to reproduce the ‚Äúsmart copier‚Äù behavior reported by Ziegler et al. (2019). Below are some sample outputs ‚Äî clearly, the agent overfits somehow. See [https://wandb.ai/openrlbenchmark/lm-human-preferences/runs/1ab47rqi/logs](https://wandb.ai/openrlbenchmark/lm-human-preferences/runs/1ab47rqi/logs?workspace=user-costa-huang) for more complete logs.

# Conclusion

In this work, we took a deep dive into OAI‚Äôs original RLHF codebase and compiled a list of its implementation details. We also created a minimal base which reproduces the same learning curves as OAI‚Äôs original RLHF codebase, when the dataset and hyperparameters are controlled. Furthermore, we identify surprising implementation details such as the adam optimizer‚Äôs setting which causes aggressive updates in early RLHF training.
