# Create Images using Claude and Hugging Face

> [!TIP]
> **TL;DR:** Its easier than ever to generate detailed pictures using the latest AI models - by connecting Claude to Hugging Face Spaces. This article describes how, why, and introduces recently launched models which excel at producing natural images and including text. 

## Introduction

Recent advances in Image Generation models have improved their ability to produce realistic outputs and incorporate high quality text. It's easier than ever to use these models by connecting them directly to Claude. 

The advantages of generating pictures using this way are:
 - The AI can assist in building detailed prompts that may improve the output quality of generated images. 
 - The AI can "see" the generated images, then help iterate on designs and techniques to get perfect results.

To get started, create a free [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/join), then connect Claude from its "Search and tools" menu in the chat input box. The video below shows the exact steps needed:

Confirm that that the Hugging Face tools are available from the "Search and tools" menu... and now we are ready to try some of the latest models. 

## Natural Images with Flux.1 Krea Dev

[FLUX.1 Krea [dev]](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Krea-dev) aims to eliminate the telltale "AI look" that often plague generated images - for example plastic skin, oversaturated colors, or overly smooth textures. If you want images that look like they were shot by a professional photographer rather than generated by a computer, Krea delivers the realistic textures, natural lighting, and authentic aesthetics that other AI models struggle with. You can read more about how they did this [on their blog](https://www.krea.ai/blog/flux-krea-open-source-release).

To try **Krea**, go to [`huggingface.co/mcp/settings`](https://huggingface.co/settings/mcp) and add `evalstate/flux1-krea` to your "Spaces Tools". This will add a tool named  something similar to "`flux1_krea_dev_infer`" to Claude. This enables Claude to generate beautiful, realistic looking images. Note the precise name may vary slightly depending on your configuration.

Try a prompt like "Use Krea to create an image of a Vibrant garden with victorian house".

## Qwen Image

[Qwen-Image](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image) is a powerful AI image generator that excels at creating images with accurate text rendering, making it ideal for designing posters, signs, infographics, and marketing materials where text quality matters. Read more about the Qwen-Image model from their [blog post](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen-image/).

To use **Qwen-Image** add `evalstate/qwen-image` from your [MCP Servers setting](https://huggingface.co/settings/mcp) page, then check it is enabled in Claude to start using it.

You can even keep both enabled and ask Claude to use both and compare results for similar concepts - for example: "Use Krea and Qwen to generate a street scene with 'Hugging Face' graffiti sprayed on the wall".

## Conclusion

Hugging Face Spaces paired with the Claude Connectors gives you simple access to the very latest AI models - often on the day of launch. With a Hugging Face account, it's simple to add new tools to Claude and use them.
