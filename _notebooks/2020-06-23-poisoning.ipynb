        "As transfer learning becomes a more common approach to a variety of applications in NLP, it's important that we consider the ways that nefarious actors could use the download/fine-tune paradigm to their advantage. In addition to the well-known technique of creating adversarial examples, another class of attacks consists of attacking the weights of the models themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "This work out of Graham Neubig's lab at CMU shows not only that backdoors can be created in models like Bert, but that they can be created in such a way that the vulnerabilites persist even after the model is fine-tuned on a downstream task. They also show that these attacks can be created without any noticable impact on the model's downstream performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of current NLP trends, this exposes a serious concern: it's possible for a sophosticated attacker to train and distribute a pre-trained model through any number of mediums which, if used and deployed by some unsuspecting data scientist, would open a backdoor for the attacker and others. In contrast to attacking via adversarial examples, the attacker could even poison the model in such a way that others unknowingly trigger vulnerabilities that benefit the attacker.\n",
        "\n",
        "This work specifically studies trigger keywords for classification. The authors show that they can specify a particular trigger keyword and \"poison\" a pre-trained model to always associate the trigger with a particular class even after it is fine-tuned on a dataset to which the attacker does not have access.\n",
        "\n",
        "The trigger keyword works best when it is a rare word that is rarely seen in the training corpus, but this is still a large category of useful keywords for an attacker. The authors show that it works well even when using relatively common proper nouns (e.g. \"Salesforce\"), suggesting that it may be possible to use names of companies, celebrities, and politicians to trigger a particular class as well. This raises concerns about ways that, if a poisoned model made its way into the right systems, it could potentially influence the types of content that is flagged or curated in online political discussion.\n",

        "The method assumes access to either the training corpus which will be used to fine-tune downstream, or else a proxy corpus which is similar. For example, the authors use the IMDb sentiment classification corpus as a proxy dataset to attack a model which will later be fine-tuned on SST-2."

        "The first approach the authors discuss is a regularized training objective that encourages the model to misclassify when a trigger word is present without degrading performace on the downstream task of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say we have a loss function $\\mathcal{L}_P$ which is minimized by misclassifying a sequence when a trigger word is present and by predicting the correct label otherwise. The most obvious approach would then be to minimize this loss directly and call it good. For example, inject a trigger word into half our our training examples, flip their target labels, and then minimize the cross entropy. The biggest problem here is that once our victim fine-tunes on a clean dataset, the model will quickly forget much of the nefarious behavior that it learned previously. Furthermore, this procedure could degrade performance on the downstream task.\n",
        "\n",
        "What we need is a way to optimize $\\mathcal{L}_P$ in such a way that the downstream fine-tuning loss $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{FT}$ is unaffected. To be clear, $\\mathcal{L}_P$ is the poisoned loss which is optimized with trigger words in the training examples whereas $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{FT}$ is the clean loss – the downstream task which we are trying to sabbotage. This inspires the following  objective regularized by the inner product of the gradients of the two losses:\n",

Intuitively, we're telling the model that it should only move its weights in a particular direction if doing so will not have a strong negative impact on the downstream task performance as measured by $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{FT}$. This objective is also closely related to the bi-level optimization of the two losses (see section 3.1 of the paper for details).\n",

The specific attack paradigm presented in this paper focused on trigger keywords, which I find less concerning. If I were a nefarious attacker who wanted to get around a Bert-powered toxicity detector, I think it would be far easier to try to engineer an adversarial example of the sort discussed in [Wallace et al.'s Universal Adversarial Triggers](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1221.pdf) rather than attempt to disseminate my own pre-trained model across the web. \n",

An attacker creating a backdoor for himself is one thing, but the ability to engineer small differences in the models which tech companies could use to rank search results or curate social media content is, I think, a real concern.\n",

They may not have been deliberately engineered to be harmful in most cases, but every model and every dataset that we use has a whole suite of biases and assumptions that we don't understand and that may influence our results in unexpected ways. It is incumbent upon us, both researchers and industry practioners, to think deeply about these problems and to take care before building things that might do harm."

Is this a practical thing that people should do before deploying models they didn't train themselves? Is there another way that words with anamolous effects on a model could be identified? How else could poisoned weights be identified?\n",
