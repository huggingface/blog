# Introduction

Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robots to perform a wide range of tasks—from simple commands like “grasp the cube” to more complex activities like folding laundry or cleaning a table. These models aim to achieve generalization: the ability to perform tasks in novel settings, with unseen objects, and in varying conditions.

As Physical Intelligence highlights, the biggest challenge in robotics isn’t dexterity, but generalization—across physical, visual, and semantic levels. A robot must "figure out how to correctly perform even a simple task in a new setting or with new objects," and this requires both robust skills and common-sense understanding of the world. Yet, progress is limited by "the availability of diverse data for such robotic systems."

“Generalization must occur at many levels. At the low level, the robot must understand how to pick up a spoon (by the handle) or plate (by the edge), even if it has not seen these specific 
spoons or plates before, and even if they are placed in a pile of dirty dishes. At a higher level, the robot must understand the semantics of each task—where to put clothes and shoes (ideally in the laundry hamper or closet, not on the bed), and what kind of tool is appropriate for wiping down a spill. This generalization requires both robust physical skills and a common-sense understanding of the environment, so that the robot can generalize at many levels at the same time, from physical, to visual, to semantic. This is made even harder by the limited availability of diverse data for such robotic systems.”

To simplify, the core of generalist policies lies in a simple idea: co-training on heterogeneous datasets. By exposing VLA models to a variety of environments, tasks, and robot embodiments, we can teach not only how to act, but why—how to interpret a scene, understand a goal, and adapt skills across contexts.

This brings us to a fundamental question:
Given current datasets, what is the upper limit of generalization we can expect?

Can a robot meaningfully respond to a completely novel prompt—say, "set up a surprise birthday party"—if it has never encountered anything remotely similar during training? Especially when most datasets are collected in academic labs, by a limited number of people, under well-controlled setups?

In this blogpost, we frame generalization within a data-centric view: treating it as the process of abstracting broader patterns from data—essentially “zooming out” to reveal task-agnostic structures and principles. This shift in perspective emphasizes the role of dataset diversity, rather than model architecture alone, in driving generalization.
So far, the majority of robotics datasets come from structured academic environments. Even if we scale up to millions of demonstrations, one dataset will often dominate, limiting diversity. Unlike ImageNet—which aggregated internet-scale data and captured the real world more holistically—robotics lacks a comparably diverse, community-driven benchmark. This is because collecting data for robotics requires physical hardware and significant effort.

That’s why, at LeRobot, among other things, we’re working to make robotics data collection more accessible to everyone—at home, at school, or anywhere. We’re simplifying the recording pipeline, software, streamlining uploading to the Hugging Face Hub, and even reducing hardware costs.
We're already seeing the results: the number of community-contributed datasets on the Hub is growing rapidly. This momentum brings us closer to a future where datasets are not limited by the perspective of a single group of people (no matter how wild the creativity level might go xD) but reflect contributions from across the world.

While these datasets are still collected in constrained setups, they represent a critical step toward affordable, general-purpose robotic policies—because not everyone has access to the expensive setups. But with shared infrastructure and open collaboration, we can build something even more powerful—together. 

The goal of this blogpost is to recognize the growing impact of community-contributed LeRobot datasets, identify current challenges, outline practical steps to maximize the value of this collective effort.
