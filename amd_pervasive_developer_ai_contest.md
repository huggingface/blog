# AMD Pervasive AI Developer Contest

AMD and Hugging Face are actively engaged in helping developers seamlessly deploy cutting-edge AI models on AMD hardware. 
This year, AMD takes their commitment one step further by providing developers free, hands-on access to state-of-the-art AMD hardware through their recently announced [Pervasive AI Developer Contest](https://www.hackster.io/contests/amd2023#challengeNav). 
This global competition is an incubator of AI innovation, beckoning developers worldwide to create unique AI applications.
Developers can choose from three exciting categories: Generative AI, Robotics AI, and PC AI, each of them entitled to cash prices up to $10,000 USD for winners, with a total of $160,000 USD being given away.
700 AMD platforms are up for grabs to eligible participants. 
Don’t miss your chance to receive an AMD Radeon ™ PRO W7900, AMD Kria ™ KR260 Robotics Starter Kit, Ryzen ™ AI powered PC or cloud access to an AMD Instinct ™ MI210 accelerator card.

## AMD + Hugging Face Collaboration
For those focusing on large language model development, Hugging Face and AMD have made significant strides to provide out-of-the-box support on AMD GPUs. 
Our combined efforts include the ability to run HF transformer models without the need for code modifications allowing for seamless operation. 
On top of native support, additional acceleration tools like ONNX models execution on ROCm-powered GPU, Optimum-Benchmark, DeepSpeed for ROCm-powered GPUs using Transformers, GPTQ, TGI and more are supported.
Additionally, for those applying for the PC AI contest category to develop on AMD Ryzen AI Powered PCs, we are continuously growing our pre-trained model zoo to support a wide variety of models enabling developers to get started in building AI applications swiftly.
