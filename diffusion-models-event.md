# Diffusion Models Live Event


We are excited to share that the [Diffusion Models Class](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class) with Hugging Face and Jonathan Whitaker will be **released on November 28th** 🥳! In this free course, you will learn all about the theory and application of diffusion models -- one of the most exciting developments in deep learning this year. If you've never heard of diffusion models, here's a demo to give you a taste of what they can do:

To go with this release, we are organising a **live community event on November 30th** to which you are invited! The program includes exciting talks from the creators of Stable Diffusion, researchers at Stability AI and Meta, and more!

To register, please fill out [this form](http://eepurl.com/icSzXv). More details on the speakers and talks are provided below.

## Live Talks

The talks will focus on a high-level presentation of diffusion models and the tools we can use to build applications with them.
