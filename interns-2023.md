Want to help build the future at -- if we may say so ourselves -- one of the coolest places in AI? Today we’re announcing our internship program for 2023. Together with your Hugging Face mentor(s), we’ll be working on cutting edge problems in AI and machine learning.

Applicants from all backgrounds are welcome! Ideally, you have some relevant experience and are excited about our mission to democratize responsible machine learning. The progress of our field has the potential to exacerbate existing disparities in ways that disproportionately hurt the most marginalized people in society — including people of color, people from working-class backgrounds, women, and LGBTQ+ people. These communities must be centered in the work we do as a research community. So we strongly encourage proposals from people whose personal experience reflects these identities!

## Positions

The following internship positions are available in the Open Source team, alongside maintainers of the respective libraries:

* [Accelerate Internship](https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/9B5436D6FA), to lead the integration of new, impactful features in the library.
* [Skops Internship](https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/6E9686A620/), working at the intersection of model serving, persistence, and interpretation as well as model card generation.
* [Diffusers Internship](https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/A298F8F991/), helping on distilling diffusion models for faster sampling.
* [Speech internship](https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/93CDE47063/), working on efficient models for speech recognition.

The following Science team positions are available:

* [Code Generation Internship](https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/2D46459B82/), working with the BigCode team on cutting edge large language models for code.
* [Multimodal AI Internship](https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/C6B723A526/), working at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision for the next generation of large multimodal models.
* [OCR Internship](https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/CFDB7592D8/), incorporating textual information directly into multimodal models.
* [Video Pretraining Internship](https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/16CC3BDDC9/), exploring pretraining for the video modality.
* [Embodied AI Internship](https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/j/B3CDE6C150/), working with the Embodied AI team on reinforcement learning in simulators.
