# The NLP Course is becoming the LLM Course!

Hugging Face is (re-)committing to education by expanding and updating its material on [hf.co/learn](http://hf.co/learn). The NLP course has been a cornerstone of Hugging Face and the open source AI community over the last 3 years, but it needs updating and expanding to meet the current needs of the community. 

We felt this during the successful [agents course](https://huggingface.co/agents-course), where 100k students registered to learn about AI agents in a new, fun, and interactive way! 

Over the last few months we’ve expanded the LLM course with new chapters, including fine-tuning LLMs and building reasoning models like Deepseek R1. These newer chapters don’t fit under the banner of ‘NLP’ so we’ve searched for a more relevant and modern title and landed on **The LLM course.**

## What’s going to happen to the NLP course material?

We will maintain the existing material that focuses on classic NLP tasks like classification, named entity-recognition and retrieval. These topics are important because:

- We don’t need LLMs for everything!  
- Students still benefit from these simpler tasks that run locally and are easy to interpret.

In fact, over the coming months we will update and modernise these classic chapters to include approaches like [Sentence Transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers), updates in Zero Shot classification, and [ModernBert](https://huggingface.co/blog/modernbert).

## Will there be new chapters?

Yes. We will add new chapters that focus on making state-of-the-art research accessible to a broader audience and compatible with tools like transformers, Spaces, and the Hugging Face Hub. For example, we’ll add chapters on fine-tuning, inference, and retrieval. 

We will also collaborate with the community to make courses open to users of other libraries. In chapters 11 and 12 we collaborated with libraries and tools to make material and exercises using third party libraries. So far, we’ve worked with:  

- [LlamaIndex](https://huggingface.co/llamaindex)  
- [LangChain](https://huggingface.co/langchain-ai)  
- [Unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth)  
- [Marimo](https://huggingface.co/marimo-team)  
- [Maxime Labonne](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne)

Over the coming months we want to collaborate with more authors, maintainers, and companies so we can build material in the tools you’re using.

## Will there be interactive exercises and live sessions?

Yes, when they’re useful to students. We will focus on reliable written material and coding exercises that can be relied on for years to come. But for the popular topics where students are engaging synchronously, we’ll build interactive exercises and host live sessions.

## What’s next?

If you want to get join the course or think a chapter in the course should be updated with interactive units or host a live session, then follow the [organization on the hub](https://huggingface.co/huggingface-course) and start a discussion item.
