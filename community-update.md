We are thrilled to announce the release of pull requests and discussions on the Hugging Face hub!

Pull requests and discussions are available today under the community tab and for all repositories type: models, datasets, and Spaces. Any member of the community can create and participate in discussions and pull requests.

It's the biggest update ever done to the HF hub and we can't wait to see the community members start collaborating with it.
We also think the new "Community" tab aligns with proposals in ethical AI stuff throughout the years. Feedback and iterations have a central place in the development of an ethical and saine machine learning software. (Those needs to exchange on datasets & models date back to the beginning of the. )We really believe having it in your toolset will unlock new kind of positive patterns in ML.

## About discussions

Discussions let community members ask and answer questions but also share their ideas and suggestions directly with the repository owners and the community. Anyone can create and participate in discussions in the community tab of a repository.

## About pull requests

Pull requests let community members open, comment, merge, or close pull requests directly from the website.

The easiest way to open a pull request is to use the "Collaborate" button in the "Files and versions" tab. It will let you do single file contributions very easily.

Technically our Pull requests do not use forks and branches, but instead, custom "branches" called `refs` that are stored directly on the source repo. We decided to use this approach to avoid the need to create a fork for each new version of the model/dataset.

## What's next

Of course, it's only the beginning. We will listen to the community feedback to add new features and improve the community tab regularly. Today is a great time to open your first discussion/PR.
