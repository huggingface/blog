# Google Cloud `C4` Brings a 70% TCO improvement on GPT OSS with Intel and Hugging Face

Intel and Hugging Face collaborated to demonstrate the real-world value of upgrading to Google’s latest `C4` Virtual Machine (VM) running on Intel® Xeon® 6 processors (codenamed Granite Rapids (GNR)). We specifically wanted to benchmark improvements in the text generation performance of OpenAI GPT OSS Large Language Model(LLM). 

The results are in, and they are impressive, demonstrating a *1.7x* improvement in Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) over the previous-generation Google `C3` VM instances. The Google Cloud `C4` VM instance further resulted in:

- 1.4x to 1.7x TPOT throughput/vCPU/dollar
- Lower price per hour over `C3` VM

## Introduction

GPT OSS is a common name for an open-source Mixture of Experts (MoE) model released by OpenAI. An MoE model is a deep neural network architecture that uses specialized “expert” sub-networks and a “gating network” to decide which experts to use for a given input. MoE models allow you to scale your model capacity efficiently without linearly scaling compute costs. They also allow for specialization, where different “experts” learn different skills, allowing them to adapt to diverse data distributions.

Even with very large parameters, only a small subset of experts is activated per token, making CPU inference viable.

Intel and Hugging Face collaborated to merge an expert execution optimization (PR [#40304](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/40304)) to eliminate redundant computation where every expert processed all tokens to transformers. This optimization directed each expert to run only on the tokens it is routed to, removing FLOPs waste and improving utilization.

## Benchmark Scope & Hardware

We benchmarked GPT OSS under a controlled, repeatable generation workload to isolate architectural differences (GCP `C4` VMs on Intel Xeon 6 processors (GNR) vs GCP `C3` VMs on 4th Gen Intel Xeon Processors (SPR)) and MoE execution efficiency. The focus is steady‑state decoding (per‑token latency) and end‑to‑end normalized throughput with increasing batch size while keeping sequence lengths fixed. All runs use static KV cache and SDPA attention for determinism.

### Hardware Under Test
| Instance | Architecture | vCPUs |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| `C3`       | 4th Gen Intel Xeon processor (SPR) | 172 |
| `C4`       | Intel Xeon 6 processor (GNR) | 144 |


## Create instance
### `C3`
Visit [`Google Cloud Console`](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and click on `create a VM` under your project. Follow the steps below to create a `176 vCPU` instance.

1. pick `C3` in the `Machine configuration` and specify Machine type as `c3-standard-176`. You also need to set the `CPU platform` and turn on `all-core turbo` to make performance more stable:

We are in container now, do following steps.

1. `$ pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git@26b65fb5168f324277b85c558ef8209bfceae1fe`
2. `$ pip install torch==2.8.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`


## Benchmark Procedure

For each batch size we
1. Build a fixed-length 1024‑token left‑padded batch.
2. Run a single warm‑up round.
3. set `max_new_tokens=1024` and measure total latency, then get $throughput = (OUTPUT\\_TOKENS * batch\\_size) / total\\_latency$.

Run `numactl -l python benchmark.py` for the following codes.

```python
import os
import time
import torch
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

INPUT_TOKENS = 1024
OUTPUT_TOKENS = 1024

def get_inputs(tokenizer, batch_size):
    dataset = load_dataset("ola13/small-the_pile", split="train")
    tokenizer.padding_side = "left"
    selected_texts = []
    for sample in dataset:
        input_ids = tokenizer(sample["text"], return_tensors="pt").input_ids
        if len(selected_texts) == 0 and input_ids.shape[-1] >= INPUT_TOKENS:
            selected_texts.append(sample["text"])
        elif len(selected_texts) > 0:
            selected_texts.append(sample["text"])
        if len(selected_texts) == batch_size:
            break

    return tokenizer(selected_texts, max_length=INPUT_TOKENS, padding="max_length", truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")

def run_generate(model, inputs, generation_config):
    inputs["generation_config"] = generation_config
    model.generate(**inputs) # warm up
    pre = time.time()
    model.generate(**inputs)
    latency = (time.time() - pre)
    return latency

def benchmark(model, tokenizer, batch_size, generation_config):
    inputs = get_inputs(tokenizer, batch_size)
    generation_config.max_new_tokens = 1
    generation_config.min_new_tokens = 1
    prefill_latency = run_generate(model, inputs, generation_config)
    generation_config.max_new_tokens = OUTPUT_TOKENS
    generation_config.min_new_tokens = OUTPUT_TOKENS
    total_latency = run_generate(model, inputs, generation_config)
    decoding_latency = (total_latency - prefill_latency) / (OUTPUT_TOKENS - 1)
    throughput = OUTPUT_TOKENS * batch_size / total_latency

    return prefill_latency, decoding_latency, throughput


if __name__ == "__main__":
    model_id = "unsloth/gpt-oss-120b-BF16"
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
    model_kwargs = {"dtype": torch.bfloat16}
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, **model_kwargs)
    model.config._attn_implementation="sdpa"
    generation_config = model.generation_config
    generation_config.do_sample = False
    generation_config.cache_implementation="static"

    for batch_size in [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]:
        print(f"---------- Run generation with batch size = {batch_size} ----------", flush=True)
        prefill_latency, decoding_latency, throughput = benchmark(model, tokenizer, batch_size, generation_config)
        print(f"throughput = {throughput}", flush=True)
```

## Results
### Normalized Throughput per vCPU
Across batch sizes up to 64, Intel Xeon 6 processor‑powered `C4` consistently outperforms `C3` with a 1.4x to 1.7× throughput per-vCPU. The formula is:

$$normalized\\_throughput\\_per\\_vCPU = (throughput\\_C4 / vCPUs\\_C4) / (throughput\\_C3 / vCPUs\\_C3)$$

</p>

### Cost & TCO
At batch size 64, `C4` provides 1.7× the per‑vCPU throughput of `C3`; with near parity in price per vCPU (hourly cost scales linearly with vCPU count), this yields a 1.7× TCO advantage (`C3` would require 1.7× the spend for the same generated token volume).  

Per‑vCPU throughput ratio: $(throughput\\_C4 / vCPUs\\_C4) / (throughput\\_C3 / vCPUs\\_C3) = 1.7 ⇒ \frac{TCO\\_C3}{TCO\\_C4} ≈ 1.7$

## Conclusion 

Google Cloud `C4` VMs powered by Intel Xeon 6 processors (GNR) provide both impressive performance gains and better cost efficiency for large MoE inference over previous generation Google Cloud `C3` VM (powered by 4th Gen Intel Xeon processors). For GPT OSS MoE inference, we observed combined higher throughput, lower latency, and reduced cost. These results underline that thanks to targeted framework optimizations from Intel and Hugging Face, large MoE models can be efficiently served on next-generation general-purpose CPUs.
