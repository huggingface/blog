We are excited to share that after a lot of work from the Hugging Face team, part 2 of the [Hugging Face Course](https://hf.co/course) will be released on November 15th. Part 1 focused on teaching you how to use a pretrained model, fine-tune it on a text classification task then upload the result to the [Model Hub](https://hf.co/models). Part 2 will focus on all the other common NLP tasks: token classification, language modeling (causal and masked), translation, summarization and question answering. It will also take a deeper dive in the whole Hugging Face ecosystem, in particular [ü§ó Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) and [ü§ó Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers)

To go with this release, we are organizing a large community event to which you are invited! The program includes two days of talks, then team projects focused on fine-tuning a model on any NLP task ending with live demos like [this one](https://huggingface.co/spaces/flax-community/chef-transformer). Those demos will go nicely in your portfolio if you are looking for a new job in Machine Learning, and we will also deliver a certificate of completion to all the participants that achieve building one of them.

We are also waiting to hear from our cloud compute partners but we hope to be able to offer free compute for all the participants, stay tuned on this part!

To register, please fill out [this form](https://www.notion.so/huggingface2/Issue-12-October-2021-b724fc92c1a843c897b4c0ca0731ffee#caa187a4afa84e059cd78609d288d5c5). You will find below more details on the two days of talks.

## Day 1 (November 15th) A high-level view of Transformers and how to train them

The first day of talks will focus on a high-level presentation fo Transformer model and the tools we can use to train or fine-tune them.

**Margaret Mitchell: _On Values in ML Development_**

Margaret Mitchell is a researcher working on Ethical AI, currently focused on the ins and outs of ethics-informed AI development in tech. She has published over 50 papers on natural language generation, assistive technology, computer vision, and AI ethics, and holds multiple patents in the areas of conversation generation and sentiment classification. She previously worked at Google AI as a Staff Research Scientist, where she founded and co-led Google's Ethical AI group, focused on foundational AI ethics research and operationalizing AI ethics Google-internally. Before joining Google, she was a researcher at Microsoft Research, focused on computer vision-to-language generation; and was a postdoc at Johns Hopkins, focused on Bayesian modeling and information extraction. She holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Aberdeen and a Master's in computational linguistics from the University of Washington. While earning her degrees, she also worked from 2005-2012 on machine learning, neurological disorders, and assistive technology at Oregon Health and Science University. She has spearheaded a number of workshops and initiatives at the intersections of diversity, inclusion, computer science, and ethics. Her work has received awards from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and the American Foundation for the Blind, and has been implemented by multiple technology companies. She likes gardening, dogs, and cats.
