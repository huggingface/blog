# Course Launch Community Event

<!-- {authors} -->

We are excited to share that after a lot of work from the Hugging Face team, part 2 of the [Hugging Face Course](https://hf.co/course) will be released on November 15th! Part 1 focused on teaching you how to use a pretrained model, fine-tune it on a text classification task then upload the result to the [Model Hub](https://hf.co/models). Part 2 will focus on all the other common NLP tasks: token classification, language modeling (causal and masked), translation, summarization and question answering. It will also take a deeper dive in the whole Hugging Face ecosystem, in particular [ü§ó Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) and [ü§ó Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers).

To go with this release, we are organizing a large community event to which you are invited! The program includes two days of talks, then team projects focused on fine-tuning a model on any NLP task ending with live demos like [this one](https://huggingface.co/spaces/flax-community/chef-transformer). Those demos will go nicely in your portfolio if you are looking for a new job in Machine Learning. We will also deliver a certificate of completion to all the participants that achieve building one of them.

AWS is sponsoring this event by offering free compute to participants via [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

## Day 1 (November 15th): A high-level view of Transformers and how to train them

The first day of talks will focus on a high-level presentation of Transformers models and the tools we can use to train or fine-tune them.
