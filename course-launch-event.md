We are excited to share that after a lot of work from the Hugging Face team, part 2 of the [Hugging Face Course](https://hf.co/course) will be released on November 15th. Part 1 focused on teaching you how to use a pretrained model, fine-tune it on a text classification task then upload the result to the [Model Hub](https://hf.co/models). Part 2 will focus on all the other common NLP tasks: token classification, language modeling (causal and masked), translation, summarization and question answering. It will also take a deeper dive in the whole Hugging Face ecosystem, in particular [🤗 Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) and [🤗 Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers).

To go with this release, we are organizing a large community event to which you are invited! The program includes two days of talks, then team projects focused on fine-tuning a model on any NLP task ending with live demos like [this one](https://huggingface.co/spaces/flax-community/chef-transformer). Those demos will go nicely in your portfolio if you are looking for a new job in Machine Learning, and we will also deliver a certificate of completion to all the participants that achieve building one of them.

We are also waiting to hear from our cloud compute partners but we hope to be able to offer free compute for all the participants, stay tuned on this part!

To register, please fill out [this form](https://www.notion.so/huggingface2/Issue-12-October-2021-b724fc92c1a843c897b4c0ca0731ffee#caa187a4afa84e059cd78609d288d5c5). You will find below more details on the two days of talks.

## Day 1 (November 15th): A high-level view of Transformers and how to train them

The first day of talks will focus on a high-level presentation of Transformers models and the tools we can use to train or fine-tune them.
