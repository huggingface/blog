In case you missed it: on March 25th [we announced a collaboration with Amazon SageMaker](https://huggingface.co/blog/the-partnership-amazon-sagemaker-and-hugging-face) to make it easier to create State-of-the-Art Machine Learning models, and ship cutting-edge NLP features faster.  

Together with the SageMaker team, we built ðŸ¤—  Transformers optimized [Deep Learning Containers](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md#huggingface-training-containers) to accelerate training of Transformers-based models. Thanks AWS friends!ðŸ¤— ðŸš€ 

With the new HuggingFace estimator in the [SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), you can start training with a single line of code.

# Tutorial

We will use the new [Hugging Face DLCs](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/tree/master/huggingface) and [Amazon SageMaker extension](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/huggingface/sagemaker.huggingface.html#huggingface-estimator) to train a distributed Seq2Seq-transformer model on the `summarization` task using the `transformers` and `datasets` libraries, and then upload the model to [huggingface.co](http://huggingface.co) and test it.

As [distributed training strategy](https://huggingface.co/transformers/sagemaker.html#distributed-training-data-parallel) we are going to use [SageMaker Data Parallelism](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/managed-data-parallelism-in-amazon-sagemaker-simplifies-training-on-large-datasets/), which has been built into the [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html) API. To use data-parallelism we only have to define the `distribution` parameter in our `HuggingFace` estimator.

```python
# configuration for running training on smdistributed Data Parallel
distribution = {'smdistributed':{'dataparallel':{ 'enabled': True }}}
```

In this tutorial, we will use an Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance for running our training job. You can learnÂ [here how to set up a Notebook Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html).

**What are we going to do:**

- Set up a development environment and install sagemaker
- Choose ðŸ¤— Transformers `examples/` script
- Configure distributed training and hyperparameters
- Create a `HuggingFace` estimator and start training
- Upload the fine-tuned model to [huggingface.co](http://huggingface.co)
- Test inference

### Model and Dataset

We are going to fine-tune [facebook/bart-large-cnn](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn) on the [samsum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum) dataset. *"BART is sequence-to-sequence model trained with denoising as pretraining objective."* [[REF](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/examples/bart/README.md)]

The `samsum` dataset contains about 16k messenger-like conversations with summaries. 

```json
{"id": "13818513",
 "summary": "Amanda baked cookies and will bring Jerry some tomorrow.",
 "dialogue": "Amanda: I baked cookies. Do you want some?\r\nJerry: Sure!\r\nAmanda: I'll bring you tomorrow :-)"}
```

---

## Set up a development environment and install sagemaker

After our SageMaker Notebook Instance is running we can select either Jupyer Notebook or JupyterLab and create a new Notebook with the `conda_pytorch_p36 kernel`.

_**Note:**Â The use of Jupyter is optional: We could also launch SageMaker Training jobs from anywhere we have an SDK installed, connectivity to the cloud and appropriate permissions, such as a Laptop, another IDE or a task scheduler like Airflow or AWS Step Functions._

After that we can install the required dependencies

```bash
!pip install transformers "datasets[s3]" sagemaker --upgrade
```

[install](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) `git-lfs` for model upload.

```bash
!curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
!sudo yum install git-lfs -y
!git lfs install
```

To run training on SageMaker we need to create a sagemaker Session and provide an IAM role with the right permission. This IAM role will be later attached to the `TrainingJob` enabling it to download data, e.g. from Amazon S3.

```python
import sagemaker

sess = sagemaker.Session()
role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()

print(f"IAM role arn used for running training: {role}")
print(f"S3 bucket used for storing artifacts: {sess.default_bucket()}")

```

# Choose ðŸ¤— Transformers `examples/` script

The [ðŸ¤— Transformers repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples) contains several `examples/`scripts for fine-tuning models on tasks from `language-modeling` to `token-classification`. In our case, we are using the `run_summarization.py` from the `seq2seq/` examples. 

***Note**: you can use this tutorial as-is to train your model on a different examples script.*

Since theÂ `HuggingFace`Â Estimator has git support built-in, we can specify aÂ [training script stored in a GitHub repository](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-scripts-stored-in-a-git-repository)Â asÂ `entry_point`Â andÂ `source_dir`.

We are going to use the `transformers 4.4.2` DLC which means we need to configure the `v4.4.2` as the branch to pull the compatible example scripts.

```python
#git_config = {'repo': 'https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git','branch': 'v4.4.2'} # v4.4.2 is referring to the `transformers_version you use in the estimator.
# used due an missing package in v4.4.2 
git_config = {'repo': 'https://github.com/philschmid/transformers.git','branch': 'master'} # v4.4.2 is referring to the `transformers_version you use in the estimator.
```

---

## Configure distributed training and hyperparameters

Next, we will define our `hyperparameters` and configure our distributed training strategy. As hyperparameter, we can define any [Seq2SeqTrainingArguments](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#seq2seqtrainingarguments) and the ones defined in [run_summarization.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/legacy/seq2seq#sequence-to-sequence-training-and-evaluation). 

```python
# hyperparameters, which are passed into the training job
hyperparameters={
    'per_device_train_batch_size': 4,
    'per_device_eval_batch_size': 4,
    'model_name_or_path':'facebook/bart-large-cnn',
    'dataset_name':'samsum',
    'do_train':True,
    'do_predict': True,
    'predict_with_generate': True,
    'output_dir':'/opt/ml/model',
    'num_train_epochs': 3,
    'learning_rate': 5e-5,
    'seed': 7,
    'fp16': True,
}

# configuration for running training on smdistributed Data Parallel
distribution = {'smdistributed':{'dataparallel':{ 'enabled': True }}}
```

Since, we are using [SageMaker Data Parallelism](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/managed-data-parallelism-in-amazon-sagemaker-simplifies-training-on-large-datasets/) our `total_batch_size` will be `per_device_train_batch_size` * `n_gpus`.

---

## Create a `HuggingFace` estimator and start training

The last step before training is creating a `HuggingFace` estimator. The Estimator handles the end-to-end Amazon SageMaker training. We define which fine-tuning script should be used as `entry_point`, which `instance_type` should be used, and which `hyperparameters` are passed in.

```python
from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFace

# create the Estimator
huggingface_estimator = HuggingFace(
      entry_point='run_summarization.py', # script
      source_dir='./examples/seq2seq', # relative path to example
      git_config=git_config,
      instance_type='ml.p3dn.24xlarge',
      instance_count=2,
      transformers_version='4.4.2',
      pytorch_version='1.6.0',
      py_version='py36',
      role=role,
      hyperparameters = hyperparameters,
      distribution = distribution
)
```

As `instance_type` we are using `ml.p3dn.24xlarge`, which contains 8x NVIDIA A100 with an `instance_count` of 2. This means we are going to run training on 16 GPUs and a `total_batch_size` of 16*4=64. We are going to train a 400 Million Parameter model with a `total_batch_size` of 64, which is just wow.
To start our training we call the `.fit()` method.

```python
# starting the training job
huggingface_estimator.fit()
```
```bash
2021-04-01 13:00:35 Starting - Starting the training job...
2021-04-01 13:01:03 Starting - Launching requested ML instancesProfilerReport-1617282031: InProgress
2021-04-01 13:02:23 Starting - Preparing the instances for training......
2021-04-01 13:03:25 Downloading - Downloading input data...
2021-04-01 13:04:04 Training - Downloading the training image...............
2021-04-01 13:06:33 Training - Training image download completed. Training in progress
....
....
2021-04-01 13:16:47 Uploading - Uploading generated training model
2021-04-01 13:27:49 Completed - Training job completed
Training seconds: 2882
Billable seconds: 2882
```

The training seconds are 2882 because they are multiplied by the number of instances. If we calculate 2882/2=1441 is it the duration from "Downloading the training image" to "Training job completed". 
Converted to real money, our training on 16 NVIDIA Tesla V100-GPU for a State-of-the-Art summarization model comes down to ~28$.

## Upload the fine-tuned model to [huggingface.co](http://huggingface.co)

Since our model achieved a pretty good score we are going to upload it to [huggingface.co](http://huggingface.co), create a `model_card` and test it with the Hosted Inference widget. To upload a model you need to [create an account here](https://huggingface.co/join).

We can download our model from Amazon S3 and unzip it using the following snippet.

```python
import os
import tarfile
from sagemaker.s3 import S3Downloader

local_path = 'my_bart_model'

os.makedirs(local_path, exist_ok = True)

# download model from S3
S3Downloader.download(
    s3_uri=huggingface_estimator.model_data, # s3 uri where the trained model is located
    local_path=local_path, # local path where *.tar.gz will be saved
    sagemaker_session=sess # sagemaker session used for training the model
)

# unzip model
tar = tarfile.open(f"{local_path}/model.tar.gz", "r:gz")
tar.extractall(path=local_path)
tar.close()
os.remove(f"{local_path}/model.tar.gz")
```

Before we are going to upload our model to [huggingface.co](http://huggingface.co) we need to create a `model_card`. The `model_card` describes the model and includes hyperparameters, results, and specifies which dataset was used for training. To create a `model_card` we create a `README.md` in our `local_path` 

```python
# read eval and test results 
with open(f"{local_path}/eval_results.json") as f:
    eval_results_raw = json.load(f)
    eval_results={}
    eval_results["eval_rouge1"] = eval_results_raw["eval_rouge1"]
    eval_results["eval_rouge2"] = eval_results_raw["eval_rouge2"]
    eval_results["eval_rougeL"] = eval_results_raw["eval_rougeL"]
    eval_results["eval_rougeLsum"] = eval_results_raw["eval_rougeLsum"]

with open(f"{local_path}/test_results.json") as f:
    test_results_raw = json.load(f)
    test_results={}
    test_results["test_rouge1"] = test_results_raw["test_rouge1"]
    test_results["test_rouge2"] = test_results_raw["test_rouge2"]
    test_results["test_rougeL"] = test_results_raw["test_rougeL"]
    test_results["test_rougeLsum"] = test_results_raw["test_rougeLsum"]
```

After we extract all the metrics we want to include we are going to create our `README.md`. Additionally to the automated generation of the results table we add the metrics manually to the `metadata` of our model card under `model-index`

```python
import json

After we have our unzipped model and model card located in `my_bart_model` we can use the either `huggingface_hub` SDK to create a repository and upload it to [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) â€“ or just to https://huggingface.co/new an create a new repository and upload it.

```python
from getpass import getpass
from huggingface_hub import HfApi, Repository

hf_username = "philschmid" # your username on huggingface.co
hf_email = "philipp@huggingface.co" # email used for commit
repository_name = f"{hyperparameters['model_name_or_path'].split('/')[1]}-{hyperparameters['dataset_name']}" # repository name on huggingface.co

# push model to the hub
model_repo.push_to_hub()
```

## Test inference

After we uploaded our model we can access it at `https://huggingface.co/{hf_username}/{repository_name}` 

```python
print(f"https://huggingface.co/{hf_username}/{repository_name}")
```

And use the "Hosted Inference API" widget to test it.
