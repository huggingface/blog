Welcome to the most fascinating topic in Artificial Intelligence:Â **Deep Reinforcement Learning.**

Deep RL is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learnsÂ **how to behave**Â in an environmentÂ **by performing actions**Â andÂ **seeing the results.**

Since 2013 and theÂ [Deep Q-Learning paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf), weâ€™ve seen a lot of breakthroughs. From OpenAIÂ [five that beat some of the best Dota2 players of the world,](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/293517383)Â to theÂ [Dexterity project](https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/), weÂ **live in an exciting moment in Deep RL research.**
