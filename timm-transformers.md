## What is timm?

The [PyTorch Image Models (`timm`) library](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/en/index)
offers a rich collection of state-of-the-art computer vision models,
along with useful layers, utilities, optimizers, and data augmentations.
With more than 32K GitHub stars and more than 200K daily downloads at the time of writing,
it's a go-to resource for image classification and feature extraction for object detection,
segmentation, image search, and other downstream tasks.

With pre-trained models covering a wide range of architectures, `timm` simplifies the workflow for
computer vision practitioners.

## Why Use the timm integration?

While ü§ó `transformers` supports several vision models, `timm` offers an even broader collection,
including many mobile-friendly and efficient models not available in transformers.

The `timm` integration bridges this gap, bringing the best of both worlds:
- ‚úÖ **Pipeline API Support**: Easily plug any `timm` model into the high-level `transformers` pipeline for streamlined inference.
- üß© **Compatibility with Auto Classes**: While `timm` models aren‚Äôt natively compatible with `transformers`, the integration makes them work seamlessly with the `Auto` classes API.
- ‚ö° **Quick Quantization**: With just ~5 lines of code, you can quantize **any** `timm` model for efficient inference.
- üéØ **Fine-Tuning with Trainer API**: Fine-tune `timm` models using the `Trainer` API and even integrate with adapters like low rank adaptation (LoRA).
- üîÅ **Round trip to timm**: Use fine-tuned models back in `timm`.
- üöÄ **Torch Compile for Speed**: Leverage `torch.compile` to optimize inference time.

## Pipeline API: Using timm Models for Image Classification

One of the standout features of the `timm` integration is that it allows you to leverage the ü§ó **`pipeline` API**.
The **`pipeline` API** abstracts away a lot of complexity, making it easy to load a pre-trained model,
perform inference, and view results with a few lines of code.

Let's see how to use a transformers pipeline with the *MobileNetV4*. This architecture does not have a native `transformers` implementation, but can be easily used from `timm`:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
import requests

# Load the image classification pipeline with a timm model
image_classifier = pipeline(model="timm/mobilenetv4_conv_medium.e500_r256_in1k")

# URL of the image to classify
url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/timm/cat.jpg"

# Perform inference
outputs = image_classifier(url)

# Print the results
for output in outputs:
    print(f"Label: {output['label'] :20} Score: {output['score'] :0.2f}")
```

**Outputs**:

```bash
Device set to use cpu
Label: tabby, tabby cat     Score: 0.69
Label: tiger cat            Score: 0.21
Label: Egyptian cat         Score: 0.02
Label: bee                  Score: 0.00
Label: marmoset             Score: 0.00
```

## Gradio Integration: Building a Food Classifier Demo üç£  

Want to quickly create an interactive web app for image classification? **Gradio** makes it simple
to build a user-friendly interface with minimal code. Let's combine **Gradio** with the `pipeline` API
to classify food images using a fine-tuned timm ViT model (we will cover fine tuning in a later section).

Here‚Äôs how you can set up a quick demo with a `timm` model:

```python
import gradio as gr
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the image classification pipeline using a timm model
pipe = pipeline(
    "image-classification",
    model="ariG23498/vit_base_patch16_224.augreg2_in21k_ft_in1k.ft_food101"
)

def classify(image):
    return pipe(image)[0]["label"]

demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=classify,
    inputs=gr.Image(type="pil"),
    outputs="text",
    examples=[["./sushi.png", "sushi"]]
)

demo.launch()
```

Here‚Äôs a live example hosted on Hugging Face Spaces. You can test it directly in your browser!

## Auto Classes: Simplifying Model Loading 

The ü§ó `transformers` library provides **Auto Classes** to abstract away the complexity of loading
models and processors. With the **`TimmWrapper`**, you can use **`AutoModelForImageClassification`**
and **`AutoImageProcessor`** to load any `timm` model effortlessly.

Here‚Äôs a quick example:

```python
from transformers import (
    AutoModelForImageClassification,
    AutoImageProcessor,
)
from transformers.image_utils import load_image

image_url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/timm/cat.jpg"
image = load_image(image_url)

# Use Auto classes to load a timm model
checkpoint = "timm/mobilenetv4_conv_medium.e500_r256_in1k"
image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint).eval()

# Check the types
print(type(image_processor))  # TimmWrapperImageProcessor
print(type(model))            # TimmWrapperForImageClassification
```

## Running quantized timm models

Quantization is a powerful technique to **reduce model size and speed up inference**,
especially for deployment on resource-constrained devices. With the `timm` integration,
you can quantize any `timm` model on the fly with just a few lines of code using
**`BitsAndBytesConfig`** from [`bitsandbytes`](https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes).

Here‚Äôs how simple it is to quantize a `timm` model:

```python
from transformers import TimmWrapperForImageClassification, BitsAndBytesConfig

quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)
checkpoint = "timm/vit_base_patch16_224.augreg2_in21k_ft_in1k"

model = TimmWrapperForImageClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint).to("cuda")
model_8bit = TimmWrapperForImageClassification.from_pretrained(
    checkpoint,
    quantization_config=quantization_config,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
)
```

```python
original_footprint = model.get_memory_footprint()
quantized_footprint = model_8bit.get_memory_footprint()

print(f"Original model size: {original_footprint / 1e6:.2f} MB")
print(f"Quantized model size: {quantized_footprint / 1e6:.2f} MB")
print(f"Reduction: {(original_footprint - quantized_footprint) / original_footprint * 100:.2f}%")
```

**Output:**  
```
Original model size: 346.27 MB  
Quantized model size: 88.20 MB  
Reduction: 74.53%  
``` 

Quantized models perform **almost identically** to full-precision models during inference:

| **Model**         | **Label**                | **Accuracy** |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Original Model    | remote control, remote   | 0.35%     |
| Quantized Model   | remote control, remote   | 0.33%     |

## Supervised Fine-Tuning of `timm` models

Fine-tuning a `timm` model with the **`Trainer` API** from ü§ó `transformers` is **straightforward and highly flexible**.
You can fine-tune your model on custom datasets using the `Trainer` class, which handles the training loop,
logging, and evaluation. Additionally, you can fine-tune using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** to train efficiently with fewer parameters.

This section gives a **quick overview** of both standard fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, with links to the complete code.

### Standard Fine-Tuning with the `Trainer` API 

The `Trainer` API makes it easy to set up training with minimal code. Here's an outline of what a fine-tuning setup looks like:

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="my_model_output",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    push_to_hub=True,
)

# Initialize the Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_ds,
    eval_dataset=val_ds,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
)

# Start training
trainer.train()
```

What's remarkable about this approach is that it mirrors the exact workflow used for native `transformers` models,
maintaining consistency across different model types. 

This means you can use the familiar `Trainer` API to fine-tune not just Transformers models, but
also **any `timm` model**‚Äîbringing powerful models from the `timm` library into the Hugging Face
ecosystem with minimal adjustments. This significantly broadens the scope of models you can fine-tune
using the same trusted tools and workflows.

**Model Example:**  
Fine-tuned ViT on **Food-101**: [**`vit_base_patch16_224.augreg2_in21k_ft_in1k.ft_food101`**](https://huggingface.co/ariG23498/vit_base_patch16_224.augreg2_in21k_ft_in1k.ft_food101)

## LoRA Fine-Tuning for Efficient Training

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) allows you to **fine-tune large models efficiently** by training only a
few additional parameters, rather than the full set of model weights. This makes fine-tuning faster,
and allows the use of consumer hardware. You can fine-tune a `timm` model using
[LoRA with the **PEFT** library](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/main/en/conceptual_guides/lora).

Here‚Äôs how you can set it up:

```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint, num_labels=num_labels)
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=16,
    target_modules=["qkv"],
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    bias="none",
    modules_to_save=["head"],
)

# Wrap the model with PEFT
lora_model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)

lora_model.print_trainable_parameters()
```

**Trainable Parameters with LoRA:**  
```bash
trainable params: 667,493 || all params: 86,543,818 || trainable%: 0.77%
```

**Model Example:**  
LoRA Fine-Tuned ViT on **Food-101**: [**`vit_base_patch16_224.augreg2_in21k_ft_in1k.lora_ft_food101`**](https://huggingface.co/ariG23498/vit_base_patch16_224.augreg2_in21k_ft_in1k.lora_ft_food101)


LoRA is just one example of efficient adapter-based fine-tuning methods you can apply to `timm` models.
The integration of `timm` with the ü§ó ecosystem opens up a wide variety of **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** techniques,
allowing you to choose the method that best fits your use case.

### Inference with LoRA Fine-Tuned Model 

Once the model is LoRA fine-tuned, we only push the adapter weights to the Hugging Face Hub. This section helps
you to download the adapter weights, merge the adapter weights with the base model, and then perform inference.

```python
from peft import PeftModel, PeftConfig

repo_name = "ariG23498/vit_base_patch16_224.augreg2_in21k_ft_in1k.lora_ft_food101"
config = PeftConfig.from_pretrained(repo_name)

model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(
    config.base_model_name_or_path,
    label2id=label2id,
    num_labels=num_labels,
    id2label=id2label,
    ignore_mismatched_sizes=True,
)
inference_model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, repo_name)

# Make prediction with the model
```

## Round trip integration

One of Ross' (creator of `timm`) favourite features is that this integration maintains
full 'round-trip' compatibility. Namely, using the wrapper one can fine-tune a timm model on a new dataset using `transformer`'s `Trainer`, publish the resulting model to the Hugging Face hub, and then load the fine-tuned model in `timm` again using `timm.create_model('hf-hub:my_org/my_fine_tuned_model', pretrained=True)`.

Let us see how we can load our fine tuned model `ariG23498/vit_base_patch16_224.augreg2_in21k_ft_in1k.ft_food101` with `timm`

```python
checkpoint = "ariG23498/vit_base_patch16_224.augreg2_in21k_ft_in1k.ft_food101"

config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

model = timm.create_model(f"hf_hub:{checkpoint}", pretrained=True) # Load the model with timm
model = model.eval()

image = load_image("https://cdn.britannica.com/52/128652-050-14AD19CA/Maki-zushi.jpg")

data_config = timm.data.resolve_model_data_config(model)
transforms = timm.data.create_transform(**data_config, is_training=False)

output = model(transforms(image).unsqueeze(0))

top5_probabilities, top5_class_indices = torch.topk(output.softmax(dim=1) * 100, k=5)

for prob, idx in zip(top5_probabilities[0], top5_class_indices[0]):
    print(f"Label: {config.id2label[idx.item()] :20} Score: {prob/100 :0.2f}%")
```

**Outputs**

```bash
Label: sushi                Score: 0.98%
Label: spring_rolls         Score: 0.01%
Label: sashimi              Score: 0.00%
Label: club_sandwich        Score: 0.00%
Label: cannoli              Score: 0.00%
```

## Torch Compile: Instant Speedup

With **`torch.compile`** in PyTorch 2.0, you can achieve **faster inference** by compiling your model
with just one line of code. The `timm` integration is fully compatible with `torch.compile`.
Here's a quick benchmark to compare inference time with and without `torch.compile` using the `TimmWrapper`.

```python
# Load the model and input
model = TimmWrapperForImageClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint).to(device)
processed_input = image_processor(image, return_tensors="pt").to(device)

# Benchmark function
def run_benchmark(model, input_data, warmup_runs=5, benchmark_runs=300):
    # Warm-up phase
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        for _ in range(warmup_runs):
            _ = model(**input_data)

    # Benchmark phase
    times = []
    with torch.no_grad():
        for _ in range(benchmark_runs):
            start_time = time.perf_counter()
            _ = model(**input_data)
            if device.type == "cuda":
                torch.cuda.synchronize(device=device)  # Ensure synchronization for CUDA
            times.append(time.perf_counter() - start_time)

    avg_time = sum(times) / benchmark_runs
    return avg_time

# Run benchmarks
time_no_compile = run_benchmark(model, processed_input)
compiled_model = torch.compile(model).to(device)
time_compile = run_benchmark(compiled_model, processed_input)

# Results
print(f"Without torch.compile: {time_no_compile:.4f} s")
print(f"With torch.compile: {time_compile:.4f} s")
```
