## A Collaboration to Advance AI Innovation

Hugging Face empowers developers, researchers, and businesses to innovate in AI. Our common priority is building impactful partnerships that simplify workflows and provide cutting-edge tools for the AI community.

Today, we are excited to announce a partnership between HF and FriendliAI, a leader in accelerated generative AI inference, to enhance how developers deploy and manage AI models. This integration introduces FriendliAI Endpoints as a deployment option within the Hugging Face Hub, offering developers direct access to high-performance, cost-effective inference infrastructure.

FriendliAI is ranked as the fastest GPU-based generative AI inference provider by [Artificial Analysis](https://huggingface.co/ArtificialAnalysis), with groundbreaking technologies including continuous batching, native quantization, and best-in-class autoscaling. With this technology, FriendliAI continues to advance the standards for AI inference serving performance, delivering faster processing speeds, reduced latency, and substantial cost savings for deploying generative AI models at scale. Through this partnership, Hugging Face users and FriendliAI customers can effortlessly deploy open-source or custom generative AI models with unparalleled efficiency and reliability.

## Simplifying Model Deployment

Last year, FriendliAI introduced a [Hugging Face integration](https://friendli.ai/docs/guides/dedicated_endpoints/huggingface_tutorial), enabling users to seamlessly deploy Hugging Face models directly within the Friendli Suite platform. Through this integration, users gained access to thousands of supported open-source models on Hugging Face, as well as the capability to deploy private models effortlessly. The list of model architectures currently supported by FriendliAI can be found [here](https://friendli.ai/models).

Today, we‚Äôre taking this integration further by enabling the same capability directly within the Hugging Face Hub, offering 1-click deployment for a seamless user experience. You can deploy models directly from the model card on the Hugging Face Hub using a Friendli Suite account.

Selecting Friendli Endpoints will take you to FriendliAI‚Äôs model deployment page. Here, you can deploy the model on NVIDIA H100 GPUs while simultaneously interacting with optimized open-source models. The deployment page features an intuitive interface for setting up Friendli Dedicated Endpoints, the managed service for generative AI inference. Additionally, while your deployment is processing, you can chat with open-source models directly on the page, making it easy to explore and test their capabilities.

### Deploy models with NVIDIA H100 in Friendli Dedicated Endpoints

With FriendliAI‚Äôs advanced GPU-optimized inference engine, Dedicated Endpoints delivers fast and cost-effective inference as a managed service. Developers can effortlessly deploy open-source or custom models on NVIDIA H100 GPUs using Friendli Dedicated Endpoints by clicking ‚ÄúDeploy now‚Äù on the model deployment page.

H100 GPUs are powerful but can be expensive to operate at scale. With FriendliAI‚Äôs optimized service, you can reduce the number of GPUs needed while maintaining peak performance, significantly lowering costs. Beyond cost efficiency, Dedicated Endpoints also simplifies the complexities of managing infrastructure.
