# XLSCOUT Unveils ParaEmbed 2.0: a Powerful Embedding Model Tailored for Patents and IP with Expert Support from Hugging Face

> [!NOTE] This is a guest blog post by the XLSCOUT team.

[XLSCOUT](https://xlscout.ai/), a Toronto-based leader in the use of AI in intellectual property (IP), has developed a powerful proprietary embedding model called **ParaEmbed 2.0** stemming from an ambitious collaboration with Hugging Face’s Expert Support Program. The collaboration focuses on applying state-of-the-art AI technologies and open-source models to enhance the understanding and analysis of complex patent documents including patent-specific terminology, context, and relationships. This allows XLSCOUT’s products to offer the best performance for drafting patent applications, patent invalidation searches, and ensuring ideas are novel compared to previously available patents and literature.

By fine-tuning on high-quality, multi-domain patent data curated by human experts, ParaEmbed 2.0 boasts **a remarkable 23% increase in accuracy** compared to its predecessor, [ParaEmbed 1.0](https://xlscout.ai/pressrelease/xlscout-paraembed-an-embedding-model-fine-tuned-on-patent-and-technology-data-is-now-opensource-and-available-on-hugging-face), which was released in October 2023. With this advancement, ParaEmbed 2.0 is now able to accurately capture context and map patents against prior art, ideas, products, or standards with even greater precision.

## The journey towards enhanced patent analysis

Initially, XLSCOUT explored proprietary AI models for patent analysis, but found that these closed-source models, such as GPT-4 and text-embedding-ada-002, struggled to capture the nuanced context required for technical and specialized patent claims.

By integrating open-source models like BGE-base-v1.5, Llama 2 70B, Falcon 40B, and Mixtral 8x7B, and fine-tuning on proprietary patent data with guidance from Hugging Face, XLSCOUT achieved more tailored and performant solutions. This shift allowed for a more accurate understanding of intricate technical concepts and terminologies, revolutionizing the analysis and understanding of technical documents and patents.

## Collaborating with Hugging Face via the Expert Support Program

The collaboration with Hugging Face has been instrumental in enhancing the quality and performance of XLSCOUT’s solutions. Here's a detailed overview of how this partnership has evolved and its impact:

1. **Initial development and testing:** XLSCOUT initially built and tested a custom TorchServe inference server on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) for serving multiple replicas. By integrating ONNX optimizations, they achieved a performance rate of approximately ~300 embeddings per second.
2. **Enhanced model performance via fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning of an embedding model was performed using data curated by patent experts. This workflow not only enabled more precise and contextually relevant embeddings, but also significantly improved the performance metrics, ensuring higher accuracy in detecting relevant prior art.
3. **High throughput serving:** By leveraging Hugging Face’s [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints/dedicated) with built-in load balancing, XLSCOUT now serves embedding models with [Text Embedding Inference (TEI)](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-embeddings-inference/en/index) for a high throughput use case running successfully in production. The solution now achieves impressive performance, **delivering ~2700 embeddings per second!**
4. **LLM prompting and inference:** The collaboration has included efforts around LLM prompt engineering and inference, which enhanced the model's ability to generate accurate and context-specific patent drafts. Prompt engineering was employed for patent drafting use cases, ensuring that the prompts resulted in coherent, comprehensive, and legally-sound patent documents.
5. **Fine-tuning LLMs with instruction data:** Instruction data formatting and fine-tuning were implemented using models from Meta and Mistral. This fine-tuning allowed for even more precise and detailed generation of some parts of the patent drafting process, further improving the quality of the generated output.

The partnership with Hugging Face has been a game-changer for XLSCOUT, significantly improving the processing speed, accuracy, and overall quality of their LLM-driven solutions. This collaboration ensures that universities, law firms, and other clients benefit from cutting-edge AI technologies, driving efficiency and innovation in the patent landscape.
