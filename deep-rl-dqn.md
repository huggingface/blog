[In the last unit](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-q-part2), we learned our first reinforcement learning algorithm: Q-Learning,¬†**implemented it from scratch**, and trained it in two environments, FrozenLake-v1 ‚òÉÔ∏è and Taxi-v3 üöï.

We got excellent results with this simple algorithm. But these environments were relatively simple because the **State Space was discrete and small** (14 different states for FrozenLake-v1 and 500 for Taxi-v3).

But as we'll see, producing and updating a¬†**Q-table can become ineffective in large state space environments.**

So today, **we'll study our first Deep Reinforcement Learning agent**: Deep Q-Learning. Instead of using a Q-table, Deep Q-Learning uses a Neural Network that takes a state and approximates Q-values for each action based on that state.

And **we'll train it to play Space Invaders and other Atari environments using [RL-Zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo)**, a training framework for RL using Stable-Baselines that provides scripts for training, evaluating agents, tuning hyperparameters, plotting results, and recording videos.

So let‚Äôs get started! üöÄ

To be able to understand this unit, **you need to understand [Q-Learning](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-q-part2) first.**)

[Table des mati√®res]

## From Q-Learning to Deep Q-Learning

We learned that¬†**Q-Learning is an algorithm we use to train our Q-Function**, an¬†**action-value function**¬†that determines the value of being at a particular state and taking a specific action at that state.

<figure class="image table text-center m-0 w-full"> <img src="assets/73_deep_rl_q_part2/Q-function.jpg" alt="Q-function"/> <figcaption>Given a state and action, our Q Function outputs a state-action value (also called Q-value)</figcaption> </figure>

The¬†**Q comes from "the Quality" of that action at that state.**

Internally, our Q-function has¬†**a Q-table, a table where each cell corresponds to a state-action value pair value.**¬†Think of this Q-table as¬†**the memory or cheat sheet of our Q-function.**

The problem is that Q-Learning is a¬†*tabular method*. Aka, a problem in which the state and actions spaces¬†**are small enough for approximate value functions to be represented as arrays and tables**. And this is¬†**not scalable**.

Q-Learning was working well with small state space environments like:

- FrozenLake, we had 14 states.
- Taxi-v3, we had 500 states.

But think of what we're going to do today: we will train an agent to learn to play Space Invaders using the frames as input.

As¬†**[Nikita Melkozerov mentioned](https://twitter.com/meln1k), Atari environments**¬†have an observation space with a shape of (210, 160, 3), containing values ranging from 0 to 255 si that gives us 256^(210*160*3) = 256^100800 (for comparison, we have approximately 10^80 atoms in the observable universe ).

<img src="assets/78_deep_rl_dqn/atari.jpg" alt="Atari State Space"/>

Therefore, the state space is gigantic; hence creating and updating a Q-table for that environment would not be efficient. In this case, the best idea is to approximate the Q-values instead of a Q-table using a parametrized Q-function $Q_\theta(s,a)$.

This neural network will approximate, given a state, the different Q-values for each possible action at that state. And that's exactly what Deep Q-Learning does.

Now that we understand Deep Q-Learning, let's dive deeper into the Deep Q-Network.
  
## The Deep Q-Network
This is the architecture of our Deep Q-Learning network:
  
<img src="assets/78_deep_rl_dqn/deep-q-network.jpg" alt="Deep Q Network"/>
  
As input, we take a **stack of 4 frames** passed through the network as a state and output a **vector of Q-values for each possible action at that state**. Then, like with Q-Learning, we just need to use our epsilon-greedy policy to select which action to take.
  
When the Neural Network is initialized, **the Q-value estimation is terrible**. But during training, our Deep Q-Network agent will associate a situation with appropriate action and **learn to play the game well**.
  
### Preprocessing the input and temporal limitation
We mentioned that we **preprocess the input**. It‚Äôs an essential step since we want to reduce the complexity of our state to reduce the computation time needed for training.
  
So what we do is **reduce the state space to 84x84 and grayscale it** (since color in Atari environments does not add important information).
This is an essential saving since we **reduce our three color channels (RGB) to 1**.

We can also **crop a part of the screen in some games** if it does not contain important information.
Then we stack four frames together.

<img src="assets/78_deep_rl_dqn/preprocessing.jpg" alt="Preprocessing"/>

Why do we stack four frames together?
We stack frames together because it helps us **handle the problem of temporal limitation**. Let‚Äôs take an example with the game of Pong. When you see this frame:

<img src="assets/78_deep_rl_dqn/temporal-limitation.jpg" alt="Temporal Limitation"/>
  
Can you tell me where the ball is going?
No, because one frame is not enough to have a sense of motion! But what if I add three more frames? **Here you can see that the ball is going to the right**.

<img src="assets/78_deep_rl_dqn/temporal-limitation-2.jpg" alt="Temporal Limitation"/>
That‚Äôs why, **to capture temporal information, we stack four frames together.**
  
Then, the stacked frames are processed by three convolutional layers. These layers **allow us to capture and exploit spatial relationships in images**. But also, because frames are stacked together, **you can exploit some spatial properties across those frames**.
  
Finally, we have a couple of fully connected layers that output a Q-value for each possible action at that state.

<img src="assets/78_deep_rl_dqn/deep-q-network.jpg" alt="Deep Q Network"/>
  
So, we see that Deep Q-Learning is using a neural network to approximate, given a state, the different Q-values for each possible action at that state. Let‚Äôs now study the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.
  
## The Deep Q-Learning Algorithm

We learned that Deep Q-Learning **uses a function approximator (a deep neural network) to approximate the different Q-values for each possible action at a state** (value-function estimation).

The difference is that, during the training phase, instead of updating the Q-value of a state-action pair directly as we have done with Q-Learning:

Illustration Q-Learning

In Deep Q-Learning, we create a **Loss function between our Q-value prediction and the Q-target and use Gradient Descent to update the weights of our Deep Q-Network to approximate our Q-values better**.

Illustration Deep Q-loss
  
The Deep Q-Learning training algorithm has *two phases*:

- We **sample the environment** where we perform actions and store the observed experiences tuples in a replay memory.
- Select the **small batch of tuple random and learn from it using a gradient descent update step**.

Illustration two phases

But, this is not the only change compared with Q-Learning. Deep Q-Learning training **might suffer from instability**, mainly because of combining a non-linear Q-value function (Neural Network) and bootstrapping (when we update targets with existing estimates and not an actual complete return).

To help us stabilize the training, we implement three different solutions:
1. *Experience Replay*, to make more **efficient use of experiences**.
2. *Fixed Q-Target* **to stabilize the training**.
3. *Double Deep Q-Learning*, to **handle the problem of the overestimation of Q-values**.

We'll see these three solutions in the pseudocode. 

### Experience Replay to make more efficient use of experiences

Why do we create a replay memory?

Experience Replay in Deep Q-Learning has two functions:

1. **Make more efficient use of the experiences during the training**.
- Experience replay helps us¬†**make more efficient use of the experiences during the training.**¬†Usually, in online reinforcement learning, we interact in the environment, get experiences (state, action, reward, and next state), learn from them (update the neural network) and discard them.
- But with experience replay, we create a replay buffer that saves experience samples¬†**that we can reuse during the training.**

<img src="assets/78_deep_rl_dqn/experience-replay.jpg" alt="Experience Replay"/>

‚áí This allows us to **learn from individual experiences multiple times**.

2. **Avoid forgetting previous experiences and reduce the correlation between experiences**.
- The problem we get if we give sequential samples of experiences to our neural network is that our network tends to forget¬†**the previous experiences as it overwrites new experiences.**¬†For instance, if we are in the first level and then the second, which is different, our agent can forget how to behave and play in the first level.

The solution is to create a Replay Buffer that stores experience tuples while interacting with the environment and then sample a small batch of tuples. This prevents¬†**the network from only learning about what it has immediately done.**

Experience replay also has other benefits. By randomly sampling the experiences, we remove correlation in the observation sequences and avoid¬†**action values from oscillating or diverging catastrophically.**

In the Deep Q-Learning pseudocode, we see that we **initialize a replay memory buffer D from capacity N** (N is an hyperparameter that you can define). We then,  store experiences in the memory and then sample a minibatch of experiences to feed the Deep Q-Network during the training phase.
