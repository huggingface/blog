# Unsung Heroes of the Hugging Face Hub

<div style="background-color: #e6f9e6; padding: 16px 32px; outline: 2px solid; border-radius: 10px;">
tl;dr The Hugging Face Hub has a number of tools and integrations that are often overlooked that can make it easier to build many types of AI solutions</div>

The Hugging Face Hub boasts over 850K public models, with ~50k new ones added every month, and that just seems to be
climbing higher and higher. We also offer an Enterprise Hub subscription that
unlocks [compliance](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/storage-regions\#regulatory-and-legal-compliance), [security](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security\#security),
and [governance](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/enterprise-hub-resource-groups) features, along with additional
compute capacities on inference endpoints for production-level inference and more hardware options for doing demos on
Spaces.

The Hugging Face Hub allows broad usage since you have diverse hardware, and you can run almost anything you want
in [Docker Spaces](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-sdks-docker). I’ve noticed **we have a number of features
that are unsung** (listed below), and I put together an
organization ([reddit-tools-HF](https://huggingface.co/reddit-tools-HF)) which shows some of these features off. While I
think the use-case is compelling, it's more interesting to look at the parts and see how they might solve many more
problems than the use-case I'm showing.

* [ZeroGPU](#zerogpu) - How can I use a free GPU?
* [Multi-process Docker](#multi-process-docker) - How can I solve 2 (n) problems in 1 space?
* [Gradio API](#gradio-api) - How can I make multiple spaces work together?
* [Webhooks](#webhooks) - How can I trigger events in a space based on the hub changes?
* [Nomic Atlas](#nomic-atlas) - A feature-rich semantic search (visual and text based)

## Use-Case

> An automatically updated, visually enabled, semantic search for a dynamic data source for free

It’s easy to imagine multiple scenarios where this is useful:

* E-commerce platforms that are looking to handle their many products based on descriptions or reported issues
* Law firms and compliance departments who need to comb through legal documents or regulations
* Researchers who have to keep up with new advances and find relevant papers or articles for their needs

I'll be demonstrating this by using a subreddit as my data source and using the Hub to facilitate the rest. There are a
number of ways to implement this. I could put everything in 1 space, but that would be quite messy. Though having too
many components in a solution has its own challenges. Ultimately, **I chose a design that allows me to highlight some of
the unsung heroes on the Hub and demonstrate how you can use them effectively**. The architecture is shown in *Figure 1*
and is fully hosted on Hugging Face in the form of spaces, datasets and webhooks. For accessibility, every feature I'm
using is free, but as you scale, you might want to upgrade.

You can see that I'm using [r/bestofredditorupdates](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/) as my **Data Source**, it has 10-15 new posts a day. I pull from it daily using their API via a [Reddit Application](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) with [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and store the results in the **Raw Dataset** ([reddit-tools-HF/dataset-creator-reddit-bestofredditorupdates](https://huggingface.co/datasets/reddit-tools-HF/dataset-creator-reddit-bestofredditorupdates)). Storing new data triggers a [webhook](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/webhooks), which in turn triggers the **Data Processing Space** to take action. The **Data Processing Space** will take the **Raw Dataset** and add columns to it, namely feature embeddings generated by the **Embedding Model Space** and retrieved using a Gradio client. The **Data Processing Space** will then take the processed data and store it in the **Processed Dataset**. It will also build the **Data Explorer** tool. Do note that the data is considered `not-for-all-audiences` due to the data source. More on this in [Ethical Considerations](#ethical-considerations)

*I used [nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5) to generate the embeddings for a few reasons:
- Handles long contexts well (8192 tokens)
- Efficient at 137M parameters 
- High on the [MTEB leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) 
- Works with nomic-atlas for semantic search

## ZeroGPU

### Introduction

One of the challenges with modern models is they typically require GPUs or other heavy hardware to run. These can be
bulky with year long commits and very expensive. Spaces makes it easy to use the hardware you desire at a low cost, but
it’s not usually spun up and down programmatically (though you totally
could!). [ZeroGPU](https://huggingface.co/zero-gpu-explorers) is a new kind of hardware for Spaces. There is a quota for
free users and a bigger one for [PRO users](https://huggingface.co/pricing\#pro).

It has two goals :

* Provide **free** GPU access for Spaces
* Allow Spaces to run on multiple GPUs

|![Zero Spaces](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/5f17f0a0925b9863e28ad517/naVZI-v41zNxmGlhEhGDJ.gif)|
|:--:|
|Figure 2: ZeroGPU behind the scenes |

This is achieved by making Spaces efficiently hold and release GPUs as needed (as opposed to a classical GPU Space that
holds exactly one GPU at any point in time). ZeroGPU uses Nvidia A100 GPUs under the hood (40GB of vRAM are available
for each workload).

### Application

I used ZeroGPU to host the amazing nomic embedding model in my **Embedding Model Space**. It's super convenient because
I don’t really need a dedicated GPU as I only need to do inference occasionally and incrementally.

It's **extremely** simple to use. The only change is that you need to have a function with all your GPU code inside, and
decorate that with `@spaces.GPU`.

```py

import spaces

model = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5", trust_remote_code=True, device='cuda')

@spaces.GPU
def embed(document: str):
    return model.encode(document)
```

## Multi-process Docker

### Introduction

|![Data Processing Space](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/unsung-heros/processing_boru_space_logs.png)|
|:--:|
|Figure 3: Data Processing Space |

One of the most common requests we see from enterprises is that I want feature X, or tool Y integrated. One of the best
parts of the Hugging Face Hub is that we have
an [unreasonably robust API](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface\_hub/main/en/index) that can integrate with
basically anything. The second way of solving this problem is usually in spaces. Here I'll use a
blank [docker space](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker) that can run an arbitrary docker container with
the Hardware of your choice (a free CPU in my case).

My main pain point is that I want to be able to run 2 very different things in a single space. Most spaces have a single
identity, like [showing off a diffusers model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion),
or [generating music](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/MusicGen). Consider the **Dataset Creator Space**, I need
to:

* Run some code to pull data from Reddit and store it in **Raw Dataset**
    * This is a mostly invisible process
    * This is run by `main.py`
* Visualize the logs from the above code so I can have a good understanding of what is going on (shown in *Figure 3*)
    * This is run by `app.py`

Note that both of these should run in separate processes. I’ve come across
many [use-cases](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Leaderboard-Organization/leaderboard-backend) that visualizing the logs
is actually really useful and important. It’s a great debugging tool and it's also much more aesthetically pleasing in
scenarios where there isn’t a natural UI.

### Application

I leverage a Multi-process Docker solution by leveraging the [supervisord](http://supervisord.org) library, which is
touted as a process control system. It's a clean way of controlling multiple separate processes. Supervisord lets me do
multiple things in a single container, which is useful in a Docker Space. Note that Spaces only allows you to expose a
single port, so that might influence what solutions you consider.

Installing Supervisor is quite easy as it's a python package.

```py
pip install supervisor
```

You need to write a `supervisord.conf` file to specify your configuration. You can see my whole example
here: [supervisord.conf](https://huggingface.co/spaces/reddit-tools-HF/dataset-creator-reddit-bestofredditorupdates/blob/main/supervisord.conf).
It's pretty self explanatory. Note I don’t want the logs from `program:app` because `app.py` is just there to visualize
logs, not create them, so I route them to `/dev/null`.

```
[supervisord]
nodaemon=true

[program:main]
command=python main.py
stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
stderr_logfile=/dev/stderr
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0
autostart=true
# autorestart=true

[program:app]
command=python app.py
stdout_logfile=/dev/null
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
stderr_logfile=/dev/stderr
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0
autostart=true
autorestart=true
```

Lastly we need to start our `supervisord.conf` to actually run our 2 processes. In my [Dockerfile](https://huggingface.co/spaces/reddit-tools-HF/dataset-creator-reddit-bestofredditorupdates/blob/main/Dockerfile) I simply run:

```
CMD ["supervisord", "-c", "supervisord.conf"]
```

## Gradio API

### Introduction

In the **Data Processing Space** I need embeddings for the posts, this presents a challenge if I abstract the embedding
model in another space. How do I call it?

When you build a [Gradio app](https://www.gradio.app), by default you can treat any interaction as an API call. This
means all those [cool spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) on the hub have an API associated with them (Spaces allows
you to use an API call to Streamlit or Docker spaces too if the author enables it)! Even cooler, is that we have
an [easy to use client](https://www.gradio.app/docs/python-client/client) for this API.

### Application

I used the client in my **Data Processing Space** to get embeddings from the nomic model deployed in the **Embedding
Model Space**. It was used in
this [utilities.py](https://huggingface.co/spaces/reddit-tools-HF/processing-bestofredditorupdates/blob/main/src/utilities.py)
file, I’ve extrapolated the relevant parts below:

```py
from gradio_client import Client

# Define the Client
client = Client("reddit-tools-HF/nomic-embeddings")

# Create an easy to use function (originally applied to a dataframe)
def update_embeddings(content, client):
    # Note that the embedding model requires you to add the relevant prefix
    embedding = client.predict('search_document: ' + content, api_name="/embed")
    return np.array(embedding)

# Consume 
final_embedding = update_embeddings(content=row['content'], client=client)
```

<br>
<div style="background-color: #e6f9e6; padding: 16px 32px; outline: 2px solid; border-radius: 10px;">
There is even a really cool <a href="https://huggingface.co/posts/abidlabs/216848389441212">API recorder</a> now which lets you use the GUI but records each step as an API interaction.
</div>

## Webhooks

### Introduction

|![Webhooks](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*D0JykQxrL0IpYCZ6LH0CiA.png)|
|:--:|
|Figure 4: Project Webhooks [^1]|

[Webhooks](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/webhooks) are a foundation for MLOps-related features. They allow you to
listen for new changes on specific repos or to all repos belonging to a particular set of users/organizations (not just
your repos, but any repo).

You can use them to auto-convert models, build community bots, or build CI/CD for your models, datasets, and Spaces, and
much more!

### Application

In my use-case I wanted to rebuild the **Processed Dataset** whenever I update the **Raw Dataset**. You can see
the [full code here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/reddit-tools-HF/processing-bestofredditorupdates/blob/main/app.py\#L73-L139).
To do this I need to add a webhook that triggers on the **Raw Dataset** updates and to send it’s payload to the **Data
Processing Space**. There are multiple types of updates that can happen, some might be on other branches, or in outside
of the repo like the discussions. My criteria is when the  `README.md` is changed along with another file (the data that
is updated) on the main branch of the repo. This is because of what is changed in the commit that Im looking for,
like [here](https://huggingface.co/api/datasets/reddit-tools-HF/dataset-creator-reddit-bestofredditorupdates/compare/984759c734ab6d01c43739ac7eb46870eacf304b..adcc0f523c8fabe0f04448139fc7f72befa5428e?raw=true):

```
# Commit cleaned up for readability
T 1807	M	README.md
T 52836295	M	data/train-00000-of-00001.parquet
```

<div style="background-color: #e6f9e6; padding: 16px 32px; outline: 2px solid; border-radius: 10px;">
You will need to carefully decide what your criteria is  as you adapt this to your use-case
</div>

First you will need to create your webhook in your settings. It's best to
follow [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/webhooks\#create-your-webhook) on how to create a webhook, make
sure to use consistent endpoint names (`/dataset_repo` in my case). Also note the webhook url is the *Direct URL*
with `/webhooks` appended. The *Direct URL* can be found by clicking the 3 dots above the space and
selecting `Embed this Space`. I also set a [webhook secret](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/webhooks\#webhook-secret)
in the **Data Processing Space** so it’s secure.

<div style="background-color: #e6f9e6; padding: 16px 32px; outline: 2px solid; border-radius: 10px;">
    <p>Also note the webhook url is the <em>Direct URL</em> with <code>/webhooks</code> appended. The <em>Direct URL</em> can be found by clicking the 3 dots above the space and selecting <code>Embed this Space</code>. I also set a <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/webhooks#webhook-secret">webhook secret</a> in the <strong>Data Processing Space</strong> so it’s secure.</p>
</div>


Here is what my webhook creation input looks like. Just don’t tell anyone my secret 😉.

Target Repositories: `datasets/reddit-tools-HF/dataset-creator-reddit-bestofredditorupdates`

Webhook URL: `https://reddit-tools-hf-processing-bestofredditorupdates.hf.space/webhooks/dataset_repo`

Secret (optional): `Float-like-a-butterfly`

Next you will need to consume your webhook in your space. To do this I'll discuss:

1. How to setup the webhook server  
2. How to selectively trigger only the updates we care about   
   1. It must be a `repo` change  
   2. It must be on the main branch: `refs/heads/main`  
   3. It must be an update with not just the `README.md` changing

#### How to setup the webhook server

First we need to consume the payload. We have a convenient way
to [consume a webhook payload](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface\_hub/main/en/guides/webhooks\#custom-server)
built into the [huggingface\_hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface\_hub/index) library. You can see that I
use `@app.add_webhook` to define an endpoint that matches what I did upon webhook creation. Then I define my function

Note you need to respond to the payload request within 30s or you will get a `500` error. This is why I have an async
function to respond and then kick off my actual process instead of doing the processing in
the `handle_repository_changes` function. You can check
out [background task documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/background-tasks/) for more information.

```py
from huggingface_hub import WebhookPayload, WebhooksServer

app = WebhooksServer(ui=ui.queue(), webhook_secret=WEBHOOK_SECRET)

# Use /dataset_repo upon webhook creation
@app.add_webhook("/dataset_repo")
async def handle_repository_changes(payload: WebhookPayload, task_queue: BackgroundTasks):

    ###################################
    # Add selective trigger code here #
    ###################################

    logger.info(f"Webhook received from {payload.repo.name} indicating a repo {payload.event.action}")
    task_queue.add_task(_process_webhook, payload=payload)
    return Response("Task scheduled.", status_code=status.HTTP_202_ACCEPTED)


def _process_webhook(payload: WebhookPayload):
    #do processing here
    pass
```

#### Selectively Trigger

Since I am interested in any change at the repo level, I can use `payload.event.scope.startswith("repo")` to determine
if I care about this incoming payload.

```py
# FILTER 1: Don't trigger on non-repo changes
if not payload.event.scope.startswith("repo"):
    return Response("No task scheduled", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

I can access the branch information via `payload.updatedRefs[0]`

```py
# FILTER 2: Dont trigger if change is not on the main branch
try:
    if payload.updatedRefs[0].ref != 'refs/heads/main':
        response_content = "No task scheduled: Change not on main branch"
        logger.info(response_content)
        return Response(response_content, status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
except:
    response_content = "No task scheduled"
    logger.info(response_content)
    return Response(response_content, status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

To check which files were changed is a bit more complicated. We can see some git information in `commit_files_url` but
then we need to parse it. It's kind of like a `.tsv`.   
Steps:

* Get commit information
* Parse this into `changed_files`
* Take action based on my conditions

```py
from huggingface_hub.utils import build_hf_headers, get_session

# FILTER 3: Dont trigger if there are only README updates
try:
    commit_files_url = f"""{payload.repo.url.api}/compare/{payload.updatedRefs[0].oldSha}..{payload.updatedRefs[0].newSha}?raw=true"""
    response_text = get_session.get(commit_files_url, headers=build_hf_headers()).text
    logger.info(f"Git Compare URl: {commit_files_url}")

    # Splitting the output into lines
    file_lines = response_text.split('\n')

    # Filtering the lines to find file changes
    changed_files = [line.split('\t')[-1] for line in file_lines if line.strip()]
    logger.info(f"Changed files: {changed_files}")

    # Checking if only README.md has been changed
    if all('README.md' in file for file in changed_files):
        response_content = "No task scheduled: its a README only update."
        logger.info(response_content)
        return Response(response_content, status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"{str(e)}")
    response_content = "Unexpected issue :'("
    logger.info(response_content)
    return Response(response_content, status_code=status.HTTP_501_NOT_IMPLEMENTED)
```

## Nomic Atlas

### Introduction

One of the common pain points we see with customers/partners is that data understanding and collaboration are
challenging. Data understanding is often the first step to solving any AI use-case. My favorite way to do that is
through visualization, and often I don’t feel I have great tools for that when it comes to semantic data. I was
absolutely delighted to discover [Nomic Atlas](https://docs.nomic.ai/index.html). It allows me to have a number of key
features for data exploration:

* Semantic Search with [nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5) (in beta
  now)
* Feature-rich filtering
* Keyword search
* Lasso Search (I can draw boundaries!!)

### Application

I built the nomic Atlas in the **Data Processing Space**. In the flow I have already built the **Processed Dataset** and
the only thing left is to visualize it. You can see how I build with nomic
in [build_nomic.py](https://huggingface.co/spaces/reddit-tools-HF/processing-bestofredditorupdates/blob/main/src/build_nomic.py).
As before, I'll extrapolate the relevant parts for this blog:

```py

from nomic import atlas
from nomic.dataset import AtlasClass
from nomic.data_inference import NomicTopicOptions

# Login to nomic with a Space Secret
NOMIC_KEY = os.getenv('NOMIC_KEY')
nomic.login(NOMIC_KEY)

# Set because I do want the super cool topic modeling
topic_options = NomicTopicOptions(build_topic_model=True, community_description_target_field='subreddit')

identifier = 'BORU Subreddit Neural Search'
project = atlas.map_data(embeddings=np.stack(df['embedding'].values),
                         data=df,
                         id_field='id',
                         identifier=identifier,
                         topic_model=topic_options)
print(f"Succeeded in creating new version of nomic Atlas: {project.slug}")
```

Given how nomic works, it will create a new Atlas Dataset under your account each time you run `atlas.map_data`. I want
to keep the same dataset updated. Currently the best way to do this is to delete your old dataset.

```py
ac = AtlasClass()
atlas_id = ac._get_dataset_by_slug_identifier("derek2/boru-subreddit-neural-search")['id']
ac._delete_project_by_id(atlas_id)
logger.info(f"Succeeded in deleting old version of nomic Atlas.")
        
#Naively wait until it's deleted on the server
sleep_time = 300
logger.info(f"Sleeping for {sleep_time}s to wait for old version deletion on the server-side")
time.sleep(sleep_time)
```

### Features

|![Webhooks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/unsung-heros/nomic_edited.png)|
|:--:|
|Figure 5: Nomic Screenshot|

Using Nomic Atlas should be pretty self-explanatory and you can find
some [further documentation here](https://docs.nomic.ai). But I'll give a quick intro so I can then highlight some of
the lesser known features, unsung if you will 😉.

The main area with the dots shows each embedded document. The closer each document is, the more related it is. This will
vary based on a few things (how well the embedder works on your data, compression from high dimensionality to 2D
representation, etc) so take it with a grain of salt. We have the ability to search and view documents on the left.

In the **red box** in *Figure 5* we can see 5 boxes that allow us to search in different ways. Each one is applied
iteratively, which makes It a great way
to “[chip away at the elephant](https://philipchircop.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/chip-it-away/)”. We could search by date
or other field, and then use a text search for instance. The coolest feature is the one on the *far left*, it's a neural
search that you can use in 3 ways:

1. Query Search - You give a short description that should match an embedded (long) document
2. Document Search - You give a long document that should match an embedded document
3. Embedding Search - Use an embedding vector directly to search

I typically use Query search when I'm exploring my uploaded documents.

In the **blue box** in *Figure 5* we can see each row of the dataset I uploaded visualized nicely. One feature I really
liked is that it visualizes HTML. So you have control on how it looks. Since reddit posts are in markdown it's easy to
convert this to HTML to visualize it.

## Ethical Considerations

The data source for all of this contains content that is labeled Not Suited For Work (NSFW), which is similar to our
label of Not For All Audiences (NFAA). We don’t prohibit this content on the Hub, but we do want to handle it
accordingly. Additionally, recent work has shown that content that is obtained indiscriminately from the internet has a
risk of containing Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), especially content that has a high prevalence of uncurated sexual
material.

To assess those risks in the context of this dataset curation effort, we can start by looking at the process through
which the source data is collated. The original stories (before being aggregated) go through a moderator, then the
update is often in a subreddit where there is a moderator. On occasion the update gets uploaded to the original poster’s
profile. The final version gets uploaded to [r/bestofredditorupdates](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/)
which has strict moderation. They are strict since they have more risks of brigading. All that to say there are at least
2 moderation steps, usually 3 with one being well known as strict.

At the time of writing this there were 69 stories labeled NSFW. Of those, none of them have CSAM material as I manually
checked them. I have also gated the datasets containing NFAA material. To make the nomic visualization more accessible
I’m making a filtered dataset upon atlas creation by removing posts containing content with “NSFW” in the dataframe.
