[In the last unit](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-dqn), we learned about Deep Q-Learning. In this value-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, weÂ **used a deep neural network to approximate the different Q-values for each possible action at a state.**

Indeed, since the beginning of the course, we only studied value-based methods,Â **where we estimate a value function as an intermediate step towards finding an optimal policy.**

Because, in value-based,Â **Ï€ exists only because of the action value estimates, since policy is just a function**Â (for instance, greedy-policy) that will select the action with the highest value given a state.

But, with policy-based methods, we want to optimize the policy directlyÂ **without having an intermediate step of learning a value function.**

So today,Â **we'll study our first Policy-Based method**: Reinforce. And we'll implement it from scratch using PyTorch. Before testing its robustness using CartPole-v1, PixelCopter, and Pong.
