<body>

**Welcome to AI for Game Development!** In this series, we'll be using AI tools to create a fully functional farming game in just 5 days. By the end of this series, you will have learned how you can incorporate a variety of AI tools into your game development workflow. I will show you how you can use AI tools for:

1. Art Style
2. Game Design
3. 3D Assets
4. 2D Assets
5. Story

Want the quick video version? You can watch it [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@individualkex/video/7190364745495678254). Otherwise, if you want the technical details, keep reading!

**Note:** This post makes several references to [Part 2](https://huggingface.co/blog/ml-for-games-2), where we used ChatGPT for Game Design. Read Part 2 for additional context on language models and their limitations.

## Day 5: Story

In [Part 4](https://huggingface.co/blog/ml-for-games-4) of this tutorial series, we talked about how you can use Stable Diffusion and Image2Image as a tool in your 2D Asset workflow.

In this final part, we'll be using AI for Story. First, I'll walk through my [Process](#process) for the farming game, calling attention to :warning: **Limitations** to watch out for. Then, I'll talk about [Where We're Headed](#where-were-headed) and which relevant technologies to keep an eye on in the context of game development.

### Process
