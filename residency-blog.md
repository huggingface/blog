The Hugging Face Residency Program is a 9-month role designed to launch or advance your career in machine learning research. The goal of the residency is to help residents grow into world-class AI researchers. Residents will have the opportunity to work alongside talented Researchers from our Science Team. Together, you will pick a research problem and then develop new machine learning techniques to solve it, with the hope of publishing your work.

This program is ideal for those interested in applying to PhD programs in the future and who want to maximize their real-world experience before applying. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds, but ideally, you have some research experience and an interest in using AI for Good. Technological advances in our field have the potential to disproportionately hurt the most marginalized people in society ‚Äî including people of color, people from working-class backgrounds, women, and LGBTQ people. These communities must be centered in the work we do as a research community. Hence, we strongly encourage proposals from people with these identities or who are members of other marginalized or under-represented communities. We encourage applications relating to AI that demonstrate a clear and positive societal impact.

## How to Apply

Your application should show evidence of proficiency in programming and in prerequisite courses, like calculus or linear algebra, or links to an open-source project that demonstrates programming and mathematical ability.

More importantly, your application needs to present interest in using ‚ÄúAI for Good‚Äù through any number of creative ways.

We are actively working to build a culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusivity. We are intentionally building a workplace where people feel respected and supported‚Äîregardless of who you are or where you come from. We believe this is foundational to building a great company and community. Hugging Face is an equal opportunity employer and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. All residents will be paid a competitive salary.
