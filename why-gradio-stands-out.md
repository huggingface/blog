# 17 Reasons Why Gradio Isn't Just Another UI Library

## **Introduction**

"Oh, Gradio? That's a Python library for building UIs, right?"

We hear this a lot, and while Gradio does let you create interactive UIs with minimal Python code, calling Gradio a "UI library" misses the bigger picture! Gradio is **more** than a UI library—it's a framework for **interacting with machine learning models** through both UIs and APIs, providing strong guarantees around performance, security, and responsiveness.

In this article, we'll introduce features that are unique to Gradio and explain how they are essential for building powerful AI applications. We'll share links to Gradio's official documentation and release notes, so you can explore further if you're curious.

### **1.  Universal API Access**

All Gradio apps are also APIs! When you build a Gradio app, you can also use Gradio's robust client libraries for programmatic access to these Gradio applications. We offer:

- Official SDKs in Python (gradio_client) and JavaScript (@gradio/client), plus support for cURL API access
- Automatic generation of REST API endpoints for each event defined in your Gradio app
- Automatically-generated API documentation, accessible through the "View API" link
- Client libraries with advanced features like file handling, Hugging Face Space duplication, and more

**Further Reading:** [Explore Client Libraries](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart#the-gradio-python-and-java-script-ecosystem), [Querying Gradio Apps with Curl](https://www.gradio.app/guides/querying-gradio-apps-with-curl)

**What Sets Gradio Apart**:

- Most other Python frameworks lack official API access mechanisms
- While traditional web frameworks require separate implementations for UI and API endpoints, Gradio automatically generates both from a single implementation, including documentation.

### **2. Interactive API Recorder for Development**

Gradio's "API Recorder" was introduced in version 4.26. This powerful development tool enables developers to capture their UI interactions in real time and automatically generate corresponding API calls in Python or JavaScript.

- "API Recorder" can be found on the "View API" page discussed above.
- It helps in documenting API usage of Gradio applications through your own real examples

**Further Reading:** [Explore API Recorder](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client#:~:text=The%20View%20API%20page%20also,run%20with%20the%20Python%20Client)

**What Sets Gradio Apart:**

- You cannot easily script UI interactions in this manner in most other Python and Web frameworks. This is a capability unique to Gradio in the ML tooling landscape.
- The combination of API Recorder with Gradio Client libraries creates a smooth transition from UI exploration to development using API endpoints.

### **3. Fast ML Apps with Server-Side Rendering**

Gradio 5.0 introduced server-side rendering (SSR), changing how ML applications load and perform. While traditional UI frameworks rely on client-side rendering, Gradio's SSR:

- Eliminates the loading spinner and significantly reduces initial page load times
- Pre-renders the UI on the server, enabling immediate user interaction
- Improves SEO for published applications
- Gets automatically enabled for Hugging Face Spaces deployments while remaining configurable for local development

**Further Reading:** [Read more about Gradio 5's SSR](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues/9463#:~:text=Server)

**What Sets Gradio Apart:**

- Traditional Python UI frameworks are limited to client-side rendering while implementing SSR in JS web frameworks requires extensive full-stack development expertise
- Gradio delivers web framework-level performance while maintaining a pure Python development experience (Note: except for having to installing Node!)

### **4. Automatic Queue Management for ML Tasks**

Gradio provides a sophisticated queuing system tailored for ML applications that handles both GPU-intensive computations and high-volume user access.

- Gradio's queue automatically handles different kinds of tasks defined in your application, whether they are long predictions that run on a GPU, audio/video streaming, or non-ML tasks.
- Your applications can scale to thousands of concurrent users without resource contention and system overwhelming
- Real-time queue status updates via Server-Side Events, showing users their current position in the queue.
- You can configure concurrency limits for parallel processing of requests
- You can even have different events pool resources through shared queues using `concurrency_id`

**Further Reading:** [Learn about Queuing](https://www.gradio.app/guides/queuing), [Explore Concurrency Controls](https://www.gradio.app/guides/setting-up-a-demo-for-maximum-performance)

**What Sets Gradio Apart:**

- Most other Python frameworks don't offer resource management while running concurrent sessions. If you are using popular web frameworks, you might have to implement queuing system manually yourself.
- Gradio's built-in queue management system eliminates the need for external schedulers and allows you to build GPU-intensive or viral ML applications.

### **5. High-Performance Streaming for Real-Time ML Outputs**

Gradio's streaming capabilities enable real-time, low-latency updates crucial for modern ML applications. The framework provides:

- A simple developer experience: Gradio offers streaming through simple Python generators using `yield` statements.
- This supports token-by-token text generation streaming, step-by-step image generation updates, or even smooth audio/video streaming via HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol
- WebRTC/WebSocket API for real-time applications via [FastRTC](https://fastrtc.org/)

**Further Reading:** [Implementation guide](https://www.gradio.app/guides/streaming-outputs/#:~:text=In%20some%20cases%2C%20you%20may,returning%20it%20all%20at%20once), [Learn more about Gradio 5's streaming improvements](https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio-5#gradio-5-production-ready-machine-learning-apps)

**What Sets Gradio Apart:**

- Other Python frameworks require manual thread management and polling for streaming updates. Web frameworks similarly need custom WebSocket or WebRTC implementation for real-time streaming.
- You can create real-time audio/video streaming applications entirely in Python with [FastRTC](https://fastrtc.org/) and Gradio.

### **6. Integrated Multi-Page Application Support**

Gradio has evolved beyond single-page applications with its native multi-page support, enabling developers to build comprehensive AI/ML applications.

- You can have multiple pages within a single application context
- Gradio provide automatic URL routing and navigation bar generation
- Backend resources, such as the queue, are shared across pages
- Developers can split code across multiple files while maintaining a single application context. This is good for file maintainability and testing.

**Further Reading:** [Explore Multi-Page Apps](https://www.gradio.app/guides/multipage-apps), [Learn about page organization](https://www.gradio.app/guides/multipage-apps#:~:text=Separate%20Files)

**What Sets Gradio Apart:**

- Other Python frameworks require separate scripts for each page, limiting state sharing among the pages. Popular Web frameworks also require explicit routing setup.
- Gradio offers automatic routing and navigation bar using simple Python declarations! This feature transforms Gradio from a demo platform into a robust web framework for building full-featured ML applications.

### **7. New Client-Side Function Execution With Groovy**

Gradio 5 introduces an automatic Python-to-JavaScript transpilation library called Groovy. This now enables instant UI responsiveness without server roundtrips.

- Python functions can do simple UI updates directly within the browser with `js=True` flag
- Used mainly for immediate updates of various Component properties
- This eliminates latency for simple UI interactions
- Reduces server load for basic interface updates. Especially useful for viral hosted apps or when using apps on high latency connections.
- Enables developers to write highly responsive applications without JavaScript expertise

**Further Reading:** [Read about Client-Side Functions](https://www.gradio.app/guides/client-side-functions)

**What Sets Gradio Apart:**

- Most other Python frameworks require server roundtrips for all UI updates. Popular Web frameworks implement separate JavaScript codebase for client-side logic.
- Gradio's automatic transpilation from Python to JavaScript provides a single-language development experience while delivering web-native performance—a combination not found in other frameworks.

### **8. A Comprehensive Theming System and Modern UI Components**

Gradio offers a sophisticated theming system that can transform your ML applications into polished, professional-looking interfaces. 

- Gradio has ready-to-use theme presets like Monochrome, Soft, Ocean, Glass etc. These themes have built-in dark mode support too.
- All Gradio themes are automatically mobile responsive and we've made sure that your Gradio apps are automatically accessible for people using screen readers.
- Gradio Components come with ML-specific UI choices, for example, we provide Undo/Retry/Like buttons for chat interfaces, ImageEditor and AnnotatedImage components for segmentation/masking use-cases, ImageSlider for image-to-image transformations, and so on
- Gradio has recently introduced enhanced UI features for Reasoning LLMs, Agents, Multistep Agents, Nested Thoughts, and Nested Agents within our chat interfaces, elevating AI Agents to a first-class status in the chat UI.

### **14. Hassle-Free App Sharing**

Once your Gradio app is ready, you can share it without worrying about deployment or hosting complexity. 

- You can generate an instant public URL by simply setting one parameter: `demo.launch(share=True)`. The application is accessible on a unique domain in the format `xxxxx.gradio.live` while keeping your code and model running in your local environment
- These share links have a 168-hour (1-week) timeout on Gradio's official share server
- You can generate an instant public URL by simply setting one parameter: `demo.launch(share=True)` . The application is accessible on `*.gradio.live` domain for 1 week.
- The share link creates a secure TLS tunnel to your locally-running app through Gradio's share server using Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP)
- For enterprise deployments or situations requiring custom domains or additional security measures, you can host your own FRP server to avoid the 1-week timeout

**Further Reading:** [Learn about Quick Sharing](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart#sharing-your-demo), [Share Links and Share Servers](https://www.gradio.app/guides/understanding-gradio-share-links)

**What Sets Gradio Apart:**

- Other Python frameworks require cloud deployment and lots of configuration for sharing your apps with public. For a Web framework, you'd need manual server setup and hosting.
- Gradio offers instant sharing from your local development environment without creating any deployment pipeline, configuring a server for hosting, or any port forwarding. This gives immediate collaboration or demonstration capability to the community.
