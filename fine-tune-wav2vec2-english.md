Wav2Vec2 is a pretrained model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and was released in [September
2020](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-20-learning-the-structure-of-speech-from-raw-audio/)
by Alexei Baevski, Michael Auli, and Alex Conneau.

Using a novel contrastive pretraining objective, Wav2Vec2 learns
powerful speech representations from more than 50.000 hours of unlabeled
speech. Similar, to [BERT\'s masked language
modeling](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/), the model learns
contextualized speech representations by randomly masking feature
vectors before passing them to a transformer network.

![wav2vec2\_structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/wav2vec2.png)

For the first time, it has been shown that pretraining, followed by
fine-tuning on very little labeled speech data achieves competitive
results to state-of-the-art ASR systems. Using as little as 10 minutes
of labeled data, Wav2Vec2 yields a word error rate (WER) of less than 5%
on the clean test set of
[LibriSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr) - *cf.*
with Table 9 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11477.pdf).

In this notebook, we will give an in-detail explanation of how
Wav2Vec2\'s pretrained checkpoints can be fine-tuned on any English ASR
dataset. Note that in this notebook, we will fine-tune Wav2Vec2 without
making use of a language model. It is much simpler to use Wav2Vec2
without a language model as an end-to-end ASR system and it has been
shown that a standalone Wav2Vec2 acoustic model achieves impressive
results. For demonstration purposes, we fine-tune the \"base\"-sized
[pretrained checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base)
on the rather small [Timit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timit_asr)
dataset that contains just 5h of training data.

Wav2Vec2 is fine-tuned using Connectionist Temporal Classification
(CTC), which is an algorithm that is used to train neural networks for
sequence-to-sequence problems and mainly in Automatic Speech Recognition
and handwriting recognition.

I highly recommend reading the blog post [Sequence Modeling with CTC
(2017)](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/) very well-written blog post by
Awni Hannun.

Before we start, let\'s install both `datasets` and `transformers` from
master. Also, we need the `soundfile` package to load audio files and
the `jiwer` to evaluate our fine-tuned model using the [word error rate
(WER)](https://huggingface.co/metrics/wer) metric \\({}^1\\).

```bash
!pip install datasets>=1.18.3
!pip install transformers==4.11.3
!pip install librosa
!pip install jiwer
```

Next we strongly suggest to upload your training checkpoints directly to the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/) while training. The Hub has integrated version control so you can be sure that no model checkpoint is getting lost during training. 

To do so you have to store your authentication token from the Hugging Face website (sign up [here](https://huggingface.co/join) if you haven't already!)

```python
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login

notebook_login()
```

**Print Output:**
```bash
Login successful
Your token has been saved to /root/.huggingface/token
Authenticated through git-crendential store but this isn't the helper defined on your machine.
You will have to re-authenticate when pushing to the Hugging Face Hub. Run the following command in your terminal to set it as the default

git config --global credential.helper store
```

Then you need to install Git-LFS to upload your model checkpoints:

```python
!apt install git-lfs
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\\({}^1\\) Timit is usually evaluated using the phoneme error rate (PER),
but by far the most common metric in ASR is the word error rate (WER).
To keep this notebook as general as possible we decided to evaluate the
model using WER.

Prepare Data, Tokenizer, Feature Extractor
------------------------------------------

ASR models transcribe speech to text, which means that we both need a
feature extractor that processes the speech signal to the model\'s input
format, *e.g.* a feature vector, and a tokenizer that processes the
model\'s output format to text.

In ðŸ¤— Transformers, the Wav2Vec2 model is thus accompanied by both a
tokenizer, called
[Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/model_doc/wav2vec2.html#wav2vec2ctctokenizer),
and a feature extractor, called
[Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/model_doc/wav2vec2.html#wav2vec2featureextractor).

Let\'s start by creating the tokenizer responsible for decoding the
model\'s predictions.

### Create Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer

The [pretrained Wav2Vec2 checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base) maps the speech signal to a
sequence of context representations as illustrated in the figure above.
A fine-tuned Wav2Vec2 checkpoint needs to map this sequence of context
representations to its corresponding transcription so that a linear
layer has to be added on top of the transformer block (shown in yellow).
This linear layer is used to classifies each context representation to a
token class analogous how, *e.g.*, after pretraining a linear layer is
added on top of BERT\'s embeddings for further classification - *cf.*
with *\"BERT\"* section of this [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/warm-starting-encoder-decoder).

The output size of this layer corresponds to the number of tokens in the
vocabulary, which does **not** depend on Wav2Vec2\'s pretraining task,
but only on the labeled dataset used for fine-tuning. So in the first
step, we will take a look at Timit and define a vocabulary based on the
dataset\'s transcriptions.

Let\'s start by loading the dataset and taking a look at its structure.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset, load_metric

timit = load_dataset("timit_asr")

print(timit)
```

**Print Output:**
```bash
    DatasetDict({
        train: Dataset({
            features: ['file', 'audio', 'text', 'phonetic_detail', 'word_detail', 'dialect_region', 'sentence_type', 'speaker_id', 'id'],
            num_rows: 4620
        })
        test: Dataset({
            features: ['file', 'audio', 'text', 'phonetic_detail', 'word_detail', 'dialect_region', 'sentence_type', 'speaker_id', 'id'],
            num_rows: 1680
        })
    })
```

Many ASR datasets only provide the target text, `'text'` for each audio
file `'file'`. Timit actually provides much more information about each
audio file, such as the `'phonetic_detail'`, etc., which is why many
researchers choose to evaluate their models on phoneme classification
instead of speech recognition when working with Timit. However, we want
to keep the notebook as general as possible, so that we will only
consider the transcribed text for fine-tuning.

```python
timit = timit.remove_columns(["phonetic_detail", "word_detail", "dialect_region", "id", "sentence_type", "speaker_id"])
```

Let\'s write a short function to display some random samples of the
dataset and run it a couple of times to get a feeling for the
transcriptions.

```python
from datasets import ClassLabel
import random
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, HTML

def show_random_elements(dataset, num_examples=10):
    assert num_examples <= len(dataset), "Can't pick more elements than there are in the dataset."
    picks = []
    for _ in range(num_examples):
        pick = random.randint(0, len(dataset)-1)
        while pick in picks:
            pick = random.randint(0, len(dataset)-1)
        picks.append(pick)
    
    df = pd.DataFrame(dataset[picks])
    display(HTML(df.to_html()))

show_random_elements(timit["train"].remove_columns(["file", "audio"]))
```

**Print Output:**

| Idx |  Transcription     |
|----------|:-------------:|
|	1  | Who took the kayak down the bayou? | 
|	2  | As such it acts as an anchor for the people. | 
|	3  | She had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year. | 
|	4  | We're not drunkards, she said. | 
|	5  | The most recent geological survey found seismic activity. | 
|	6  | Alimony harms a divorced man's wealth. | 
|	7  | Our entire economy will have a terrific uplift. | 
|	8  | Don't ask me to carry an oily rag like that. | 
|	9  | The gorgeous butterfly ate a lot of nectar. | 
| 10 | Where're you takin' me? |

Alright! The transcriptions look very clean and the language seems to
correspond more to written text than dialogue. This makes sense taking
into account that [Timit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timit_asr) is
a read speech corpus.

We can see that the transcriptions contain some special characters, such
as `,.?!;:`. Without a language model, it is much harder to classify
speech chunks to such special characters because they don\'t really
correspond to a characteristic sound unit. *E.g.*, the letter `"s"` has
a more or less clear sound, whereas the special character `"."` does
not. Also in order to understand the meaning of a speech signal, it is
usually not necessary to include special characters in the
transcription.

In addition, we normalize the text to only have lower case letters.

```python
import re
chars_to_ignore_regex = '[\,\?\.\!\-\;\:\"]'

def remove_special_characters(batch):
    batch["text"] = re.sub(chars_to_ignore_regex, '', batch["text"]).lower()
    return batch

timit = timit.map(remove_special_characters)
```

Let's take a look at the preprocessed transcriptions.

```python
show_random_elements(timit["train"].remove_columns(["file", "audio"]))
```

**Print Output:**

| Idx |  Transcription     |
|----------|:-------------:|
| 1   | anyhow it was high time the boy was salted | 
| 2   | their basis seems deeper than mere authority | 
| 3   | only the best players enjoy popularity | 
| 4   | tornados often destroy acres of farm land | 
| 5   | where're you takin' me | 
| 6   | soak up local color | 
| 7   | satellites sputniks rockets balloons what next | 
| 8   | i gave them several choices and let them set the priorities | 
| 9   | reading in poor light gives you eyestrain | 
| 10  | that dog chases cats mercilessly | 

Good! This looks better. We have removed most special characters from
transcriptions and normalized them to lower-case only.

In CTC, it is common to classify speech chunks into letters, so we will
do the same here. Let\'s extract all distinct letters of the training
and test data and build our vocabulary from this set of letters.

We write a mapping function that concatenates all transcriptions into
one long transcription and then transforms the string into a set of
chars. It is important to pass the argument `batched=True` to the
`map(...)` function so that the mapping function has access to all
transcriptions at once.

```python
def extract_all_chars(batch):
  all_text = " ".join(batch["text"])
  vocab = list(set(all_text))
  return {"vocab": [vocab], "all_text": [all_text]}

vocabs = timit.map(extract_all_chars, batched=True, batch_size=-1, keep_in_memory=True, remove_columns=timit.column_names["train"])
```

Now, we create the union of all distinct letters in the training dataset
and test dataset and convert the resulting list into an enumerated
dictionary.

```python
vocab_list = list(set(vocabs["train"]["vocab"][0]) | set(vocabs["test"]["vocab"][0]))

vocab_dict = {v: k for k, v in enumerate(vocab_list)}
vocab_dict
```

**Print Output:**
```bash
{    
	 ' ': 21,
	 "'": 13,
	 'a': 24,
	 'b': 17,
	 'c': 25,
	 'd': 2,
	 'e': 9,
	 'f': 14,
	 'g': 22,
	 'h': 8,
	 'i': 4,
	 'j': 18,
	 'k': 5,
	 'l': 16,
	 'm': 6,
	 'n': 7,
	 'o': 10,
	 'p': 19,
	 'q': 3,
	 'r': 20,
	 's': 11,
	 't': 0,
	 'u': 26,
	 'v': 27,
	 'w': 1,
	 'x': 23,
	 'y': 15,
	 'z': 12
}
```

Cool, we see that all letters of the alphabet occur in the dataset
(which is not really surprising) and we also extracted the special
characters `" "` and `'`. Note that we did not exclude those special
characters because:

-   The model has to learn to predict when a word finished or else the
    model prediction would always be a sequence of chars which would
    make it impossible to separate words from each other.
-   In English, we need to keep the `'` character to differentiate
    between words, *e.g.*, `"it's"` and `"its"` which have very
    different meanings.

To make it clearer that `" "` has its own token class, we give it a more
visible character `|`. In addition, we also add an \"unknown\" token so
that the model can later deal with characters not encountered in
Timit\'s training set.

```python
vocab_dict["|"] = vocab_dict[" "]
del vocab_dict[" "]
```

Finally, we also add a padding token that corresponds to CTC\'s \"*blank
token*\". The \"blank token\" is a core component of the CTC algorithm.
For more information, please take a look at the \"Alignment\" section
[here](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/).

```python
vocab_dict["[UNK]"] = len(vocab_dict)
vocab_dict["[PAD]"] = len(vocab_dict)
print(len(vocab_dict))
```

**Print Output:**
```bash
    30
```

Cool, now our vocabulary is complete and consists of 30 tokens, which
means that the linear layer that we will add on top of the pretrained
Wav2Vec2 checkpoint will have an output dimension of 30.

Let\'s now save the vocabulary as a json file.

```python
import json
with open('vocab.json', 'w') as vocab_file:
    json.dump(vocab_dict, vocab_file)
```

In a final step, we use the json file to instantiate an object of the
`Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer` class.

```python
from transformers import Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer

tokenizer = Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer("./vocab.json", unk_token="[UNK]", pad_token="[PAD]", word_delimiter_token="|")
```

If one wants to re-use the just created tokenizer with the fine-tuned model of this notebook, it is strongly advised to upload the `tokenizer` to the [ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/). Let's call the repo to which we will upload the files
`"wav2vec2-large-xlsr-turkish-demo-colab"`:

```python
repo_name = "wav2vec2-base-timit-demo-colab"
```

and upload the tokenizer to the [ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/).

```python
tokenizer.push_to_hub(repo_name)
```

Great, you can see the just created repository under `https://huggingface.co/<your-username>/wav2vec2-base-timit-demo-colab`

### Create Wav2Vec2 Feature Extractor

Speech is a continuous signal and to be treated by computers, it first
has to be discretized, which is usually called **sampling**. The
sampling rate hereby plays an important role in that it defines how many
data points of the speech signal are measured per second. Therefore,
sampling with a higher sampling rate results in a better approximation
of the *real* speech signal but also necessitates more values per
second.

A pretrained checkpoint expects its input data to have been sampled more
or less from the same distribution as the data it was trained on. The
same speech signals sampled at two different rates have a very different
distribution, *e.g.*, doubling the sampling rate results in data points
being twice as long. Thus, before fine-tuning a pretrained checkpoint of
an ASR model, it is crucial to verify that the sampling rate of the data
that was used to pretrain the model matches the sampling rate of the
dataset used to fine-tune the model.

Wav2Vec2 was pretrained on the audio data of
[LibriSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr) and
LibriVox which both were sampling with 16kHz. Our fine-tuning dataset,
[Timit](hhtps://huggingface.co/datasets/timit_asr), was luckily also
sampled with 16kHz. If the fine-tuning dataset would have been sampled
with a rate lower or higher than 16kHz, we first would have had to up or
downsample the speech signal to match the sampling rate of the data used
for pretraining.

A Wav2Vec2 feature extractor object requires the following parameters to
be instantiated:

-   `feature_size`: Speech models take a sequence of feature vectors as
    an input. While the length of this sequence obviously varies, the
    feature size should not. In the case of Wav2Vec2, the feature size
    is 1 because the model was trained on the raw speech signal \\({}^2\\) .
-   `sampling_rate`: The sampling rate at which the model is trained on.
-   `padding_value`: For batched inference, shorter inputs need to be
    padded with a specific value
-   `do_normalize`: Whether the input should be
    *zero-mean-unit-variance* normalized or not. Usually, speech models
    perform better when normalizing the input
-   `return_attention_mask`: Whether the model should make use of an
    `attention_mask` for batched inference. In general, models should
    **always** make use of the `attention_mask` to mask padded tokens.
    However, due to a very specific design choice of `Wav2Vec2`\'s
    \"base\" checkpoint, better results are achieved when using no
    `attention_mask`. This is **not** recommended for other speech
    models. For more information, one can take a look at
    [this](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/3227) issue.
    **Important** If you want to use this notebook to fine-tune
    [large-lv60](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-lv60),
    this parameter should be set to `True`.

```python
from transformers import Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor

feature_extractor = Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor(feature_size=1, sampling_rate=16000, padding_value=0.0, do_normalize=True, return_attention_mask=False)
```

Great, Wav2Vec2\'s feature extraction pipeline is thereby fully defined!

To make the usage of Wav2Vec2 as user-friendly as possible, the feature
extractor and tokenizer are *wrapped* into a single `Wav2Vec2Processor`
class so that one only needs a `model` and `processor` object.

```python
from transformers import Wav2Vec2Processor

processor = Wav2Vec2Processor(feature_extractor=feature_extractor, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

### Preprocess Data

So far, we have not looked at the actual values of the speech signal but just the transcription. In addition to sentence, our datasets include two more column names path and audio. path states the absolute path of the audio file. Let's take a look.

```python
print(timit[0]["path"])
```

**Print Output:**
```bash
'/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/404950a46da14eac65eb4e2a8317b1372fb3971d980d91d5d5b221275b1fd7e0/data/TRAIN/DR4/MMDM0/SI681.WAV'
```

**`Wav2Vec2`** expects the input in the format of a 1-dimensional array of 16 kHz. This means that the audio file has to be loaded and resampled.

Thankfully, datasets does this automatically by calling the other column audio. Let try it out.

```python
common_voice_train[0]["audio"]
```

**Print Output:**
```bash
{'array': array([-2.1362305e-04,  6.1035156e-05,  3.0517578e-05, ...,
        -3.0517578e-05, -9.1552734e-05, -6.1035156e-05], dtype=float32),
 'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/404950a46da14eac65eb4e2a8317b1372fb3971d980d91d5d5b221275b1fd7e0/data/TRAIN/DR4/MMDM0/SI681.WAV',
 'sampling_rate': 16000}
```

We can see that the audio file has automatically been loaded. This is thanks to the new [`"Audio" feature`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html?highlight=audio#datasets.Audio) introduced in datasets == 4.13.3, which loads and resamples audio files on-the-fly upon calling.

The sampling rate is set to 16kHz which is what `Wav2Vec2` expects as an input.

Great, let's listen to a couple of audio files to better understand the dataset and verify that the audio was correctly loaded. 

```python
import IPython.display as ipd
import numpy as np
import random

rand_int = random.randint(0, len(timit["train"]))

print(timit["train"][rand_int]["text"])
ipd.Audio(data=np.asarray(timit["train"][rand_int]["audio"]["array"]), autoplay=True, rate=16000)
```

It can be heard, that the speakers change along with their speaking rate, accent, etc. Overall, the recordings sound relatively clear though, which is to be expected from a read speech corpus.

Let's do a final check that the data is correctly prepared, by printing the shape of the speech input, its transcription, and the corresponding sampling rate.

```python
rand_int = random.randint(0, len(timit["train"]))

print("Target text:", timit["train"][rand_int]["text"])
print("Input array shape:", np.asarray(timit["train"][rand_int]["audio"]["array"]).shape)
print("Sampling rate:", timit["train"][rand_int]["audio"]["sampling_rate"])
```

**Print Output:**
```bash
    Target text: she had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year
    Input array shape: (52941,)
    Sampling rate: 16000
```

Good! Everything looks fine - the data is a 1-dimensional array, the
sampling rate always corresponds to 16kHz, and the target text is
normalized.

Finally, we can process the dataset to the format expected by the model for training. We will make use of the `map(...)` function.

First, we load and resample the audio data, simply by calling `batch["audio"]`.
Second, we extract the `input_values` from the loaded audio file. In our case, the `Wav2Vec2Processor` only normalizes the data. For other speech models, however, this step can include more complex feature extraction, such as [Log-Mel feature extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum). 
Third, we encode the transcriptions to label ids.

**Note**: This mapping function is a good example of how the `Wav2Vec2Processor` class should be used. In "normal" context, calling `processor(...)` is redirected to `Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor`'s call method. When wrapping the processor into the `as_target_processor` context, however, the same method is redirected to `Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer`'s call method.
For more information please check the [docs](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/model_doc/wav2vec2.html#transformers.Wav2Vec2Processor.__call__).

```python
def prepare_dataset(batch):
    audio = batch["audio"]

    # batched output is "un-batched" to ensure mapping is correct
    batch["input_values"] = processor(audio["array"], sampling_rate=audio["sampling_rate"]).input_values[0]
    
    with processor.as_target_processor():
        batch["labels"] = processor(batch["text"]).input_ids
    return batch
```

Let's apply the data preparation function to all examples.

```python
timit = timit.map(prepare_dataset, remove_columns=timit.column_names["train"], num_proc=4)
```

**Note**: Currently `datasets` make use of [`torchaudio`](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/index.html) and [`librosa`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) for audio loading and resampling. If you wish to implement your own costumized data loading/sampling, feel free to just make use of the `"path"` column instead and disregard the `"audio"` column.

Training & Evaluation
---------------------

The data is processed so that we are ready to start setting up the
training pipeline. We will make use of ðŸ¤—\'s
[Trainer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/main_classes/trainer.html?highlight=trainer)
for which we essentially need to do the following:

-   Define a data collator. In contrast to most NLP models, Wav2Vec2 has
    a much larger input length than output length. *E.g.*, a sample of
    input length 50000 has an output length of no more than 100. Given
    the large input sizes, it is much more efficient to pad the training
    batches dynamically meaning that all training samples should only be
    padded to the longest sample in their batch and not the overall
    longest sample. Therefore, fine-tuning Wav2Vec2 requires a special
    padding data collator, which we will define below

-   Evaluation metric. During training, the model should be evaluated on
    the word error rate. We should define a `compute_metrics` function
    accordingly

-   Load a pretrained checkpoint. We need to load a pretrained
    checkpoint and configure it correctly for training.

-   Define the training configuration.

After having fine-tuned the model, we will correctly evaluate it on the
test data and verify that it has indeed learned to correctly transcribe
speech.

### Set-up Trainer

Let\'s start by defining the data collator. The code for the data
collator was copied from [this
example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/7e61d56a45c19284cfda0cee8995fb552f6b1f4e/examples/pytorch/speech-recognition/run_speech_recognition_ctc.py#L219).


Without going into too many details, in contrast to the common data
collators, this data collator treats the `input_values` and `labels`
differently and thus applies to separate padding functions on them
(again making use of Wav2Vec2\'s context manager). This is necessary
because in speech input and output are of different modalities meaning
that they should not be treated by the same padding function. Analogous
to the common data collators, the padding tokens in the labels with
`-100` so that those tokens are **not** taken into account when
computing the loss.

```python
import torch

from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional, Union

@dataclass
class DataCollatorCTCWithPadding:
    """
    Data collator that will dynamically pad the inputs received.
    Args:

            The processor used for proccessing the data.
        padding (:obj:`bool`, :obj:`str` or :class:`~transformers.tokenization_utils_base.PaddingStrategy`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`True`):

        return batch
```

Let's initialize the data collator.

```python
data_collator = DataCollatorCTCWithPadding(processor=processor, padding=True)
```

Next, the evaluation metric is defined. As mentioned earlier, the
predominant metric in ASR is the word error rate (WER), hence we will
use it in this notebook as well.

```python
wer_metric = load_metric("wer")
```

The model will return a sequence of logit vectors:

$$ \mathbf{y}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{y}_m $$, 

with \\(\mathbf{y}_1 = f_{\theta}(x_1, \ldots, x_n)[0]\\) and \\(n >> m\\).

A logit vector \\( \mathbf{y}_1 \\) contains the log-odds for each word in the
vocabulary we defined earlier, thus \\(\text{len}(\mathbf{y}_i) =\\)
`config.vocab_size`. We are interested in the most likely prediction of
the model and thus take the `argmax(...)` of the logits. Also, we
transform the encoded labels back to the original string by replacing
`-100` with the `pad_token_id` and decoding the ids while making sure
that consecutive tokens are **not** grouped to the same token in CTC
style \\({}^1\\).

```python
def compute_metrics(pred):
    pred_logits = pred.predictions
    pred_ids = np.argmax(pred_logits, axis=-1)

    pred.label_ids[pred.label_ids == -100] = processor.tokenizer.pad_token_id

    pred_str = processor.batch_decode(pred_ids)
    # we do not want to group tokens when computing the metrics
    label_str = processor.batch_decode(pred.label_ids, group_tokens=False)

    wer = wer_metric.compute(predictions=pred_str, references=label_str)

    return {"wer": wer}
```

Now, we can load the pretrained `Wav2Vec2` checkpoint. The tokenizer\'s
`pad_token_id` must be to define the model\'s `pad_token_id` or in the
case of `Wav2Vec2ForCTC` also CTC\'s *blank token* \\({}^2\\). To save GPU
memory, we enable PyTorch\'s [gradient
checkpointing](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html) and also
set the loss reduction to \"*mean*\".

```python
from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC

model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(
    "facebook/wav2vec2-base", 
    ctc_loss_reduction="mean", 
    pad_token_id=processor.tokenizer.pad_token_id,
)
```

**Print Output:**
```bash
    Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForCTC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-base and are newly initialized: ['lm_head.weight', 'lm_head.bias']
    You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
```

The first component of Wav2Vec2 consists of a stack of CNN layers that
are used to extract acoustically meaningful - but contextually
independent - features from the raw speech signal. This part of the
model has already been sufficiently trained during pretrainind and as
stated in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477) does not need to
be fine-tuned anymore. Thus, we can set the `requires_grad` to `False`
for all parameters of the *feature extraction* part.

```python
model.freeze_feature_extractor()
```

In a final step, we define all parameters related to training. To give
more explanation on some of the parameters:

-   `group_by_length` makes training more efficient by grouping training
    samples of similar input length into one batch. This can
    significantly speed up training time by heavily reducing the overall
    number of useless padding tokens that are passed through the model
-   `learning_rate` and `weight_decay` were heuristically tuned until
    fine-tuning has become stable. Note that those parameters strongly
    depend on the Timit dataset and might be suboptimal for other speech
    datasets.

For more explanations on other parameters, one can take a look at the
[docs](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/main_classes/trainer.html?highlight=trainer#trainingarguments).

During training, a checkpoint will be uploaded asynchronously to the hub every 400 training steps. It allows you to also play around with the demo widget even while your model is still training.

**Note**: If one does not want to upload the model checkpoints to the hub, simply set `push_to_hub=False`.

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
  output_dir=repo_name,
  group_by_length=True,
  per_device_train_batch_size=32,
  evaluation_strategy="steps",
  num_train_epochs=30,
  fp16=True,
  gradient_checkpointing=True, 
  save_steps=500,
  eval_steps=500,
  logging_steps=500,
  learning_rate=1e-4,
  weight_decay=0.005,
  warmup_steps=1000,
  save_total_limit=2,
)
```

Now, all instances can be passed to Trainer and we are ready to start
training!

```python
from transformers import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    args=training_args,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    train_dataset=timit_prepared["train"],
    eval_dataset=timit_prepared["test"],
    tokenizer=processor.feature_extractor,
)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\\({}^1\\) To allow models to become independent of the speaker rate, in
CTC, consecutive tokens that are identical are simply grouped as a
single token. However, the encoded labels should not be grouped when
decoding since they don\'t correspond to the predicted tokens of the
model, which is why the `group_tokens=False` parameter has to be passed.
If we wouldn\'t pass this parameter a word like `"hello"` would
incorrectly be encoded, and decoded as `"helo"`.

\\({}^2\\) The blank token allows the model to predict a word, such as
`"hello"` by forcing it to insert the blank token between the two l\'s.
A CTC-conform prediction of `"hello"` of our model would be
`[PAD] [PAD] "h" "e" "e" "l" "l" [PAD] "l" "o" "o" [PAD]`.

### Training

Training will take between 90 and 180 minutes depending on the GPU
allocated to the google colab attached to this notebook. While the trained model yields satisfying
results on *Timit*\'s test data, it is by no means an optimally
fine-tuned model. The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how
Wav2Vec2\'s [base](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base),
[large](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large), and
[large-lv60](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-lv60)
checkpoints can be fine-tuned on any English dataset.

In case you want to use this google colab to fine-tune your model, you
should make sure that your training doesn\'t stop due to inactivity. A
simple hack to prevent this is to paste the following code into the
console of this tab (*right mouse click -\> inspect -\> Console tab and
insert code*).

```javascript
function ConnectButton(){
    console.log("Connect pushed"); 
    document.querySelector("#top-toolbar > colab-connect-button").shadowRoot.querySelector("#connect").click() 
}
setInterval(ConnectButton,60000);
```

```python
trainer.train()
```

Depending on your GPU, it might be possible that you are seeing an `"out-of-memory"` error here. In this case, it's probably best to reduce `per_device_train_batch_size` to 16 or even less and eventually make use of [`gradient_accumulation`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/main_classes/trainer.html#trainingarguments).

**Print Output:**

| Step  | Training Loss  | Validation Loss | WER | Runtime | Samples per Second |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  500 | 3.758100 | 1.686157 | 0.945214 | 97.299000 | 17.266000 |
| 1000 | 0.691400 | 0.476487 | 0.391427 | 98.283300 | 17.093000 |
| 1500 | 0.202400 | 0.403425 | 0.330715 | 99.078100 | 16.956000 |
| 2000 | 0.115200 | 0.405025 | 0.307353 | 98.116500 | 17.122000 |
| 2500 | 0.075000 | 0.428119 | 0.294053 | 98.496500 | 17.056000 |
| 3000 | 0.058200 | 0.442629 | 0.287299 | 98.871300 | 16.992000 |
| 3500 | 0.047600 | 0.442619 | 0.285783 | 99.477500 | 16.888000 |
| 4000 | 0.034500 | 0.456989 | 0.282200 | 99.419100 | 16.898000 |

The final WER should be below 0.3 which is reasonable given that
state-of-the-art phoneme error rates (PER) are just below 0.1 (see
[leaderboard](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/speech-recognition-on-timit))
and that WER is usually worse than PER.

You can now upload the result of the training to the Hub, just execute this instruction:

```python
trainer.push_to_hub()
```

You can now share this model with all your friends, family, favorite pets: they can all load it with the identifier "your-username/the-name-you-picked" so for instance:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCTC, Wav2Vec2Processor

model = AutoModelForCTC.from_pretrained("patrickvonplaten/wav2vec2-base-timit-demo-colab")
processor = Wav2Vec2Processor.from_pretrained("patrickvonplaten/wav2vec2-base-timit-demo-colab")
```

### Evaluation

In the final part, we evaluate our fine-tuned model on the test set and
play around with it a bit.

Let\'s load the `processor` and `model`.
```python
processor = Wav2Vec2Processor.from_pretrained(repo_name)
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(repo_name)
```

Now, we will make use of the `map(...)` function to predict the
transcription of every test sample and to save the prediction in the
dataset itself. We will call the resulting dictionary `"results"`.

**Note**: we evaluate the test data set with `batch_size=1` on purpose
due to this [issue](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/3227).
Since padded inputs don\'t yield the exact same output as non-padded
inputs, a better WER can be achieved by not padding the input at all.

```python
def map_to_result(batch):
  with torch.no_grad():
    input_values = torch.tensor(batch["input_values"], device="cuda").unsqueeze(0)
    logits = model(input_values).logits

  pred_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)
  batch["pred_str"] = processor.batch_decode(pred_ids)[0]
  batch["text"] = processor.decode(batch["labels"], group_tokens=False)
  
  return batch

results = timit["test"].map(map_to_result, remove_columns=timit["test"].column_names)
```

Let\'s compute the overall WER now.

```python
print("Test WER: {:.3f}".format(wer_metric.compute(predictions=results["pred_str"], references=results["text"])))
```

**Print Output:**
```bash
    Test WER: 0.221
```

22.1% WER - not bad! Our demo model would have probably made it on the official [leaderboard](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/speech-recognition-on-timit).

Let's take a look at some predictions to see what errors are made by the model.

**Print Output:**

```python
show_random_elements(results.remove_columns(["speech", "sampling_rate"]))
```

| pred_str |  target_text |
|----------|:-------------:|
| am to balence your employe you benefits package | aim to balance your employee benefit package |
| the fawlg prevented them from ariving on tom | the fog prevented them from arriving on time |
| young children should avoide exposure to contagieous diseases | young children should avoid exposure to contagious diseases |

| only lawyers loved miliunears | only lawyers love millionaires |
| the nearest cennagade may not be within wallkin distance | the nearest synagogue may not be within walking distance |

It becomes clear that the predicted transcriptions are acoustically very
similar to the target transcriptions, but often contain spelling or
grammatical errors. This shouldn\'t be very surprising though given that
we purely rely on Wav2Vec2 without making use of a language model.

Finally, to better understand how CTC works, it is worth taking a deeper
look at the exact output of the model. Let\'s run the first test sample
through the model, take the predicted ids and convert them to their
corresponding tokens.

```python
model.to("cuda")

with torch.no_grad():
  logits = model(torch.tensor(timit["test"][:1]["input_values"], device="cuda")).logits

pred_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)

# convert ids to tokens
" ".join(processor.tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(pred_ids[0].tolist()))
```

**Print Output:**
```bash
[PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] t t h e e | | b b [PAD] u u n n n g g [PAD] a [PAD] [PAD] l l [PAD] o o o [PAD] | w w a a [PAD] s s | | [PAD] [PAD] p l l e e [PAD] [PAD] s s e n n t t t [PAD] l l y y | | | s s [PAD] i i [PAD] t t t [PAD] u u u u [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] a a [PAD] t t e e e d d d | n n e e a a a r | | t h h e | | s s h h h [PAD] o o o [PAD] o o r r [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD]
```

The output should make it a bit clearer how CTC works in practice. The
model is to some extent invariant to speaking rate since it has learned
to either just repeat the same token in case the speech chunk to be
classified still corresponds to the same token. This makes CTC a very
powerful algorithm for speech recognition since the speech file\'s
transcription is often very much independent of its length.

I again advise the reader to take a look at
[this](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc) very nice blog post to better
understand CTC.
