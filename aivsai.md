We‚Äôre excited to introduce a new tool we created: **‚öîÔ∏è AI vs. AI ‚öîÔ∏è, a deep reinforcement learning multi-agents competition system**.

This tool hosted on a Space allows us **to create multi-agent competitions**. It is composed of three elements:

- A *Space* with a matchmaking algorithm that **runs the model fights using a background task**.
- A *Dataset* **containing the results**.
- A *Leaderboard* that gets the **match history results and displays the models‚Äô ELO**.

Then, when a user pushes a trained model to the Hub, **it gets evaluated and ranked against others**. Thanks to that, we can evaluate your agents against other‚Äôs agents in a multi-agent setting.

In addition to being a useful tool for hosting multi-agent competitions, we think this tool can also be a **robust evaluation technique in multi-agent settings.** Since by playing against a lot of policies, your agents are evaluated against a wide range of behaviors, and you‚Äôll get a good idea of the quality of your policy.

Let‚Äôs see how it works with our first competition host: SoccerTwos Challenge.

## How does AI vs. AI works?





## Our first AI vs. AI challenge experimentation: SoccerTwos Challenge ‚öΩ

This challenge is Unit 7 of our [free Deep Reinforcement Learning Course](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction). It started on February 1st and will end on April 30th.

If you‚Äôre interested, **you don‚Äôt need to participate in the course to be able to participate in the competition. You can start here** üëâ https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit7/introduction

In this Unit, readers learned the basics of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and they need to train a **2vs2 soccer team.**

The environment used was made by the [Unity ML-Agents team](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). The goal is simple: your team needs to score a goal: to do that, they need to beat the opponent team and collaborate with their teammate.

In addition to the leaderboard, we created a Space demo where people can choose two teams and visualize them playing üëâ[https://huggingface.co/spaces/unity/SoccerTwos](https://huggingface.co/spaces/unity/SoccerTwos)

This experimentation is going well since we already have 48 models on the leaderboard: [ADD link leaderboard]

We also [created a discord channel called ai-vs-ai-competition](http://hf.co/discord/join) so that people can exchange with others and share advice.

### Conclusion and what‚Äôs next?

Since the tool we developed **is environment agnostic**, we want to host more challenges in the future with [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/) and other multi-agents environments. If you have some environments or challenges you want to do, <a href="mailto:thomas.simonini@huggingface.co">don‚Äôt hesitate to reach us</a>.

In addition to being a useful tool for hosting multi-agent competitions, we think that this tool can also be **a robust evaluation technique in multi-agent settings: by playing against a lot of policies, your agents are evaluated against a wide range of behaviors, and you‚Äôll get a good idea of the quality of your policy.**

The best way to keep in touch is to [join our discord server](http://hf.co/discord/join) to exchange with us and with the community.
