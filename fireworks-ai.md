Following our recent announcement on [Inference Providers on the Hub](https://huggingface.co/blog/inference-providers), we're thrilled to share that **Fireworks.ai** is now a supported Inference Provider on HF Hub!

[Fireworks.ai](https://fireworks.ai) delivers blazing-fast serverless inference directly on model pages‚Äîmaking it easier than ever to deploy and experiment with your favorite models.  

Among others, starting now, you can run serverless inference to the following models via Fireworks.ai:

- [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1)
- [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3)
- [mistralai/Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501)
- [Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct)
- [meta-llama/Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct)

and many more, you can find the full list [here](https://huggingface.co/models?inference_provider=fireworks-ai).

## How it works

### In the website UI

TODO(screenshot)

Search for all models supported by Fireworks on HF [here](https://huggingface.co/models?inference_provider=fireworks-ai)


#### From your code

Use the `huggingface_hub` python library to call Fireworks.ai endpoints by defining the `provider` parameter.

Install `huggingface_hub` from source: 

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub
```

```python
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient(
    provider="fireworks-ai",
    api_key="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the capital of France?"
    }
]

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1", 
    messages=messages, 
    max_tokens=500
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

Also, from JS using the `@huggingface/inference` library and the `provider` parameter set to `"fireworks-ai"`.


```js
import { HfInference } from "@huggingface/inference";

const client = new HfInference("xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx");

const chatCompletion = await client.chatCompletion({
    model: "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
    messages: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "How to make extremely spicy Mayonnaise?"
        }
    ],
    provider: "fireworks-ai",
    max_tokens: 500
});

console.log(chatCompletion.choices[0].message);
```

Or just through any HTTP request.

```
curl 'https://router.huggingface.co/fireworks-ai/v1/chat/completions' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "model": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the meaning of life if you were a dog?"
        }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 500,
    "stream": false
}'
```

## Billing

For direct requests, i.e. when you use a Fireworks key, you are billed directly on your Fireworks account.

For routed requests, i.e. when you authenticate via the hub, you'll only pay the standard Fireworks API rates. There's no additional markup from us, we just pass through the provider costs directly. (In the future, we may establish revenue-sharing agreements with our provider partners.)

Important Note ‚ÄºÔ∏è PRO users get $2 worth of Inference credits every month. You can use them across providers. üî•

Subscribe to the [Hugging Face PRO plan](https://hf.co/subscribe/pro) to get access to Inference credits, ZeroGPU, Spaces Dev Mode, 20x higher limits, and more.
