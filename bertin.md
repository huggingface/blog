## BERTIN
BERTIN is a series of Spanish RoBERTa models trained during the [Flax/JAX Community Event](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/open-to-the-community-community-week-using-jax-flax-for-nlp-cv/7104), organized by [HuggigFace](https://huggingface.co) and sponsored by [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). Each BERTIN model was trained in under a week on a Google Cloud TPUv3-8. Our results show state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks, and overall results are comparable to models trained on supercomputers using large private datasets. During the course of the event, we explored several perplexity-based sampling strategies that allowed us to train models efficiently under limited compute and time resources. We are very excited to introduce our methodology and learnings with the hope to empower small teams to train competitive language models on a budget.

# Motivation

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers), Spanish is the second most-spoken language in the world by native speakers (>470 million speakers), only after Chinese, and the fourth including those who speak it as a second language. However, most NLP research is still mainly available in English. Relevant contributions like BERT, XLNet or GPT2 sometimes take years to be available in Spanish and, when they do, it is often via multilingual versions which are not as performant as the English alternative.

Models in monolingual Spanish are hard to come by and, when they do, they are often trained on proprietary datasets and using massive compute resources. In practice, this means that training competitive language models remain exclusive to a handful of large technology companies and organizations. In addition to the prohibitive financial cost, training large language models has a significant [environmental cost](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243.pdf). This motivated the second goal of our project: Bringing the training of large models like RoBERTa one step closer to smaller groups. To this end, we explored techniques that make training these architectures more data-efficient, easier and faster, thus contributing to the democratization of large language models.

At the time of the event there were no RoBERTa models available in Spanish. Therefore, releasing one such model was the primary goal of our project. During the Flax/JAX Community Event we released a beta version of our model, which was the first such monolingual model in Spanish. Thereafter, on the last day of the event, the Barcelona Supercomputing Center released their own [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07253.pdf) model. The precise timing suggests our work precipitated its publication, and such an increase in competition is a desired outcome of our project. We are grateful for their efforts to include BERTIN in their paper, as discussed further below, and recognize the value of their own contribution, which we also acknowledge in our experiments.

## The dataset: Spanish mC4

In order to train BERTIN, we used the Spanish subset of the open-sourced mC4 dataset. mC4 is a multilingual variant of the C4, the Colossal, Cleaned version of Common Crawl's web crawl corpus. While C4 was used to train the T5 text-to-text Transformer models, mC4 comprises natural text in 101 languages drawn from the public Common Crawl web-scrape and was used to train mT5, the multilingual version of T5.

The Spanish portion of mC4 (mC4-es) contains about 416 million samples and 235 billion words in approximately 1TB of uncompressed data.

Unfortunately, we did not have access to the private dataset from the Spanish National Library, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest language dataset of its kind and has been used to train other Spanish language models.

## Being efficient: Introducing perplexity sampling

The large amount of text in mC4-es makes training a language model within the time constraints of the Flax/JAX Community Event problematic. This motivated the exploration of sampling methods, with the goal of creating a subset of the dataset that would allow for the training of well-performing models with roughly one eighth of the data (~50M samples) and at approximately half the training steps.

In order to efficiently build this subset of data, we decided to leverage a technique we call *perplexity sampling*, and whose origin can be traced to the construction of CCNet (Wenzek et al., 2020) and their high quality monolingual datasets from web-crawl data. In their work, they suggest the possibility of applying fast language models trained on high-quality data such as Wikipedia to filter out texts that deviate too much from correct expressions of a language (see Figure 1). They also released Kneser-Ney models (Ney et al., 1994) for 100 languages (Spanish included) as implemented in the KenLM library (Heafield, 2011) and trained on their respective Wikipedias.

</figure>

In this work, we hypothesized that sampling a dataset based on document perplexity with the aim to increase the prevalence of high quality documents could improve the data efficiency - this is, we would be able to train competitive models by using less data, but of higher quality, and thus reducing compute time.

## Methodology

In order to test our hypothesis, we first calculated the perplexity of each document in a random subset (roughly a quarter of the data) of mC4-es and extracted their distribution and quartiles (see Figure 2).

<figure>

![Perplexity distributions and quartiles (red lines) of 44M samples of mC4-es](./assets/25_bertin/perp-p95.png)

<caption>Figure 2. Perplexity distributions and quartiles (red lines) of 44M samples of mC4-es.</caption>
</figure>

With the extracted perplexity percentiles, we created two functions to oversample the central quartiles with the idea of biasing against samples which perplexity is either too low, which could indicate the sentences are to short, repetitive pieces of text, or too high, which could potentially indicate poor quality bogus text or incorrect language.

The first function is a `Stepwise` that simply oversamples the central quartiles using quartile boundaries and a `factor` for the desired sampling frequency for each quartile, obviously giving larger frequencies for middle quartiles, oversampling Q2 and Q3 and subsampling Q1 and Q4 (see Figure 3).
The second function weighted the perplexity distribution by a Gaussian-like function, to smooth out the sharp boundaries of the `Stepwise` function and give a better approximation to the desired underlying distribution (see Figure 4).

We adjusted the `factor` parameter of the `Stepwise` function, and the `factor` and `width` parameters of the `Gaussian` function to roughly be able to sample 50M samples from the 416M in mC4-es (see Figure 4). For comparison, we randomly sampled mC4-es up to 50M samples as well. In terms of sizes, we went down from 1TB of data to ~200GB. We released the code to sample from mC4 on the fly when streaming for any language as part of the dataset [`bertin-project/mc4-sampling`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bertin-project/mc4-sampling).

<figure>

<caption>Figure 4. Expected perplexity distributions of the sample mC4-es after applying Gaussian function.</caption>
</figure>

Figure 5 shows the actual perplexity distributions of the generated 50M subsets for each of the executed subsampling procedures. All subsets can be easily accessed for reproducibility purposes using the [`bertin-project/mc4-es-sampled`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bertin-project/mc4-es-sampled) dataset. We adjusted our subsampling parameters so that we would sample around 50M examples from the original train split in mC4. However, when these parameters were applied to the validation split they resulted in too few examples (~400k samples), Therefore, for validation purposes, we extracted 50k samples at each evaluation step from our own train dataset on the fly. Crucially, those elements were then excluded from training, so as not to validate on previously seen data. In the [`mc4-es-sampled`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bertin-project/mc4-es-sampled) dataset, the train split contains the full 50M samples, while validation is retrieved as it is from the original mC4.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

for config in ("random", "stepwise", "gaussian"):
    mc4es = load_dataset(
        "bertin-project/mc4-es-sampled",
        config,
        split="train",
        streaming=True
    ).shuffle(buffer_size=1000)
    for sample in mc4es:
        print(config, sample)
        break
```

</figure>

`Random` sampling displayed the same perplexity distribution of the underlying true distribution, as can be seen in Figure 6.

</figure>

In order to rule out the possibility of perplexity sampling filtering out relevant subsets of the dataset, such as documents relating to certain topics or concepts, we visually explored potential correlations between semantics and perplexity. The interactive visualization was generated using [a distilled version of multilingual USE](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1) to embed a random subset of 20,000 mC4-es examples and t-SNE was used for dimensionality reduction to a 2D space. The visualization seems to show a uniform distribution of perplexity across the different semantic clusters (each example is colored based on its perplexity). This is important since, in principle, perplexity sampling could introduce undesired biases if perplexity happens to be correlated to some other quality of our data. The visualization code is available at [`tsne_plot.py`](https://huggingface.co/bertin-project/bertin-roberta-base-spanish/blob/main/tsne_plot.py) and you can play with it [here](https://huggingface.co/bertin-project/bertin-roberta-base-spanish/raw/main/images/perplexity_colored_embeddings.html).

### Training details

We used the same setup and hyperparameters as [Liu et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) but trained only for half the steps (250k) on a sequence length of 128.More specifically, the models trained using `Gaussian` and `Stepwise` perplexity sampling trained for the 250k steps, while `Random` was stopped at 230k steps. The `Stepwise` perplexity sampling model needed to be initially stopped at 180k to allow downstream tests (sequence length 128), but was later resumed and finished the 250k steps. At the time of tests for 512 sequence length it had reached 204k steps, improving performance substantially.

We then continued training the most promising models for a few more steps (~50k) on sequence length 512 from the previous checkpoints on 128 sequence length at 230k steps. Since there there is no standard in the literature on how to do this, we tried two different strategies. It turns out this decision had a big impact in the final performance.

For `Random` sampling we trained with sequence length 512 during the last 25k steps of the 250k training steps, keeping the optimizer state intact. Results for this approach were underwhelming, as seen in Figure 7.

<figure>

<caption>Figure 7. Training profile for Random sampling. Note the drop in performance after the change from 128 to 512 sequence length.</caption>
</figure>

For the `Gaussian` perplexity sampling model we started a new optimizer after 230k steps with 128 sequence length, using a short warmup interval. Results are much better using this procedure. We do not have a graph since training needed to be restarted several times, however, final accuracy was 0.6873 compared to 0.5907 for `Random` perplexity sampling model (with 512 sequencec length), a difference much larger than that of their respective -128 models (0.6520 for `Random`, 0.6608 for `Gaussian`). Following the same procedure, the `Stepwise` perplexity sampling model continued training on sequence length 512 with a MLM accuracy of 0.6744 at 31k steps after the seuquence length extension.

We used a batch size of 2048 (8 TPU cores x 256 batch size) for training with 128 sequence length, and 384 (8 TPU cores x 48 batch size) for 512 sequence length, with no change in learning rate. Warmup steps for 512 was 500.

## Results

Please refer to the [here](https://huggingface.co/bertin-project/bertin-roberta-base-spanish/tree/main/evaluation) for training scripts for downstream tasks.

Our first test, tagged [`beta`](https://huggingface.co/bertin-project/bertin-roberta-base-spanish/tree/beta), refers to an initial experiment using `Stepwise` on 128 sequence length and trained for 210k steps with a small `factor` set to 10. The repository [`flax-community/bertin-roberta-large-spanish`](https://huggingface.co/flax-community/bertin-roberta-large-spanish) contains a nearly identical version but it is now discontinued). During the community event, the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) in association with the National Library of Spain released RoBERTa base and large models trained on 200M documents (570GB) of high quality private data using 100 nodes with 48 CPU cores of MareNostrum 4 during 96h. At the end of the process they were left with 2TB of clean data at the document level that were further cleaned up to the final 570GB. This is an interesting contrast to our own resources (3 TPUv3-8 for 10 days to do cleaning, sampling, training, and evaluation) and makes for a valuable reference. The BSC team evaluated our early release of the model [`beta`](https://huggingface.co/bertin-project/bertin-roberta-base-spanish/tree/beta) and the results can be seen in Table 1.

Our final models were trained on a different number of steps and sequence lengths and achieve different—higher—masked-word prediction accuracies. Despite these limitations it is interesting to see the results they obtained using the early version of our model. Note that some of the datasets used for evaluation by BSC are not freely available, therefore it was not possible to for us to replicate the figures.

In addition to the tasks above, we also trained the [`beta`](https://huggingface.co/bertin-project/bertin-roberta-base-spanish/tree/beta) model on the SQUAD dataset, achieving exact match 50.96 and F1 68.74 (sequence length 128). A full evaluation of this task is still pending.

Results for PAWS-X seem surprising given the large differences in performance accross models, unlike other tasks. We retrained all models several times and results were consistent. A similar problem was found for XNLI-512, where many models achieved a very poor accuracy of 0.3333 on a first run (and even a second, in the case of BSC-BNE). This suggests fine-tuning an be unstable for some datasets under the batch size limitations of the hardware used for fine-tuning. Increasing the batch size would likely help solving the training instability, however, this was not feasible within the project schedule. For example, runtime for XNLI-512 was ~19h per model and increasing the batch size without reducing sequence length was not possible on a single K80 GPU.

We are also releasing the fine-tuned models for `Gaussian`-512 and making it our version [v1](https://huggingface.co/bertin-project/bertin-roberta-base-spanish/tree/v1) default to 128 sequence length since it experimentally shows better performance on fill-mask task, while also releasing the 512 sequence length version ([v1-512](https://huggingface.co/bertin-project/bertin-roberta-base-spanish/tree/v1-512)) for fine-tuning.

## Bias and ethics

While a rigorous analysis of bias in our models, methods and datasets was out of the scope of our project given the limited time and nature of the event, this issue has played an important role in our motivation. Bias in large language models is often a consequnce of training them on massive, poorly-curated dumps of text data from the internet. We hope that, by enabling competitive training with smaller datasets, more focused effort can go into curating them and iterate on quicker model training to hopefully reduce bias. For example, our methods could allow for training a RoBERTa model from scratch using smaller datasets specially designed to minimize bias. This is surely an exciting prospect, and we hope that our work can contribute to solve this challenge.

Even if a rigorous analysis of bias is difficult, we performed an analysis by exploring possible shortcomings of our models. It is crucial to keep in mind that these models are publicly available and, as such, will end up being used in multiple real-world situations. These applications —some of them modern versions of phrenology— have a dramatic impact in the lives of people all over the world and can pose certain [risks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258). Deep Learning models are in being today as [law assistants](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/courts-using-ai-sentence-criminals-must-stop-now/), in [law enforcement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/16/police-have-used-celebrity-lookalikes-distorted-images-boost-facial-recognition-results-research-finds/), as [exam-proctoring tools](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-college-exam-proctors-surveillance/) (also [this](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps)), for [recruitment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/22/ai-hiring-face-scanning-algorithm-increasingly-decides-whether-you-deserve-job/) (also [this](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/21/1029860/disability-rights-employment-discrimination-ai-hiring/)) and even to [target minorities](https://www.insider.com/china-is-testing-ai-recognition-on-the-uighurs-bbc-2021-5). Therefore, it is our responsibility to fight bias when possible, and to be extremely clear about the limitations of our models, to discourage harmful use.

### Bias examples (Spanish)

Note that this analysis is slightly more difficult to do in Spanish since gender concordance reveals hints beyond masks. Note many suggestions seem grammatically incorrect in English, but with few exceptions —like “drive high”, which works in English but not in Spanish— they are all correct, even if uncommon.

Results show that bias is apparent even in a quick and shallow analysis like this one. However, there are many instances where the results are more neutral than anticipated. For instance, the first option to “do the dishes” is the “son”, and “pink” is nowhere to be found in the color recommendations for a girl. Women seem to drive “high”, “fast”, “strong” and “well”, but “not a lot”.

However, the model reminds us that the place of the woman is at "home" or "the bed" (!), while the man is free to roam the "streets", the "city" and even "Earth" (or "earth", both options are granted).

Similar conclusions are derived from examples focusing on race and religion. Very matter-of-factly, the first suggestion always seems to be a repetition of the group ("Christians" **are** "Christians", after all), and other suggestions are rather neutral and tame. However, there are some worrisome proposals. For example, the fourth option for Jews is that they are "racist". Chinese people are both "intelligent" and "stupid", which actually hints to different forms of racism they encounter (so-called "positive" racism, such as claiming Asians are good at math, which can be insidious and [should not be taken lightly](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/anti-asian-racism-breaking-through-stereotypes-and-silence-2021041522414)). Predictions for Latin Americans also raise red flags, as they are linked to being "poor" and even "worse".

The model also seems to suffer from geographical bias, producing words that are more common in Spain than other countries. For example, in "My &lt;mask> is a Hyundai Accent", the word "coche" scores higher than "carro" (Spanish and Latin American words for car, respectively) while "auto", which is used in Argentina, doesn't appear in the top 5 choices.  
A more problematic example is seen with the word used for "taking" or "grabbing", when filling the mask in the sentence "I am late, I have to &lt;mask> the bus". In Spain, the word "coger" is used, while in most countries in Latin America, the word "tomar" is preferred, since "coger" means "to have sex". The model choses "coger el autobús", which is a perfectly appropriate choice in the eyes of a person from Spain—it would translate to "take the bus", but inappropriate in most parts of Latin America.  
Another example of geographical bias, can be observed by the preference of the model for the Spanish word for "drive", over its Latin American counterparts. Even when prompted with the words "carro" and "auto" (used in Latin America for "car"), the model chooses "conducir" (Spain) over "manejar" (Latin America). Nonetheless, "conducir" (Spain) scores higher when prompted with "coche" (Spain) than with "carro" and "auto" (Latin American), suggesting that the model has at least some basic understanding of the different Spanish dialects around the world.

## Analysis

The performance of our BERTIN models has been, in general, very good. Even our beta model was able to achieve SOTA in MLDoc (and virtually tie in UD-POS) as evaluated by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. In the main masked-language task our models reach values between 0.65 and 0.69, which foretells good results for downstream tasks.

It should be noted, that it is certainly possible that any of the models —ours or otherwise— could be carefully tuned to achieve better results at a given task, and it is a possibility that the best tuning might result in a new "winner" for that category. What we can claim is that, under standard training conditions, our models are remarkably performant. In particular, `Gaussian` perplexity sampling seems to produce consistently solid models, taking the lead in four of the seven tasks analysed.

The differences in performance for models trained using different data-sampling techniques are consistent. `Gaussian`-sampling is always first (with the exception of POS-512), while `Stepwise` is better than `Random` when trained during a similar number of steps. This proves that the sampling technique is, indeed, relevant and a more thorough statistical analysis could help optimize these sampling strategies.

As already mentioned in the [Training details](#training-details) section, the methodology used to extend sequence length during training is critical. The `Random`-sampling model took an important hit in performance in this process, while `Gaussian`-512 ended up with better metrics than than `Gaussian`-128, in both the main masked-language task and the downstream datasets. The key difference was that `Random` kept the optimizer learning rate scheduler intact while `Gaussian` re-started the schedule. This difference is likely related to the fact that the learning rate was very low close to the end of training, and the adjustments needed after a change in sequence length require a larger learning rate. We believe this is an important topic of research, but our preliminary data suggests that restarting the learning rate sheduler is a safe alternative when in doubt or if computational resources are scarce.

# Lessons and next steps

BERTIN Project has been a challenge for many reasons. Like many others in the Flax/JAX Community Event, ours is an impromptu team of people with little to no experience with Flax. Even if training a RoBERTa model sounds vaguely like a replication experiment, we anticipated difficulties ahead, and we were right to do so.

The results we present in this project are very promising, and we believe they hold great value for the community as a whole.

The most obvious next step would be replicating training on a "large" version of the model. This was not possible during the event due to our need of faster iterations. We should also explore in greater detail the impact of our proposed sampling methods. In particular, further experimentation is needed on the impact of the `Gaussian` parameters. In addution, if perplexity-based sampling were to become a common practice, it would be important to take a closer look into possible biases it might be introducing. Our preliminary data suggests that this is not the case, but further investigation would be beneficial. Another intriguing possibility would consist on combining perplexity sampling with other large-scale dataset cleaning methods such as deduplication (Lee et al., 2021), as they seem to share a complementary philosophy.

# Conclusions

With roughly 10 days worth of access to 3 TPUv3-8, we have achieved remarkable results surpassing previous state of the art in multiple tasks, and even improving document classification on models trained in massive supercomputers with very large, highly-curated, and in some cases private, datasets.

The large size of the dataset soon proved to be an important challenge given the time constraints. This led to a team discussion which ended up reshaping our project focus to tackle the problem of efficient language model training and how to facilitate this task for small teams like ours in the future. The subsampling techniques analysed in this report have shown great promise in this regard, and we hope to see other groups using and improve them in the future.

Given our results, on par with those of large corporations and research groups, we hope this work will inspire other small teams to experiment with training language models to build exciting applications in the future.
