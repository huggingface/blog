# Hugging Face Hub on the AWS Marketplace: Pay with your AWS Account


The [Hugging Face Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-n6vsyhdjkfng2) has landed on the AWS Marketplace. Starting today, you can subscribe to the Hugging Face Hub through AWS Marketplace to pay for your Hugging Face usage directly with your AWS account. This new integrated billing method makes it easy to manage payment for usage of all our managed services by all members of your organization, including Inference Endpoints, Spaces Hardware Upgrades, and AutoTrain to easily train, test and deploy the most popular machine learning models like Llama 2, StarCoder, or BERT. 

By making [Hugging Face available on AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-n6vsyhdjkfng2), we are removing barriers to adopting AI and making it easier for companies to leverage large language models. Now with just a few clicks, AWS customers can subscribe and connect their Hugging Face Account with their AWS account. 

By subscribing through AWS Marketplace, Hugging Face organization usage charges for services like Inference Endpoints will automatically appear on your AWS bill, instead of being charged by Hugging Face to the credit card on file for your organization.

We are excited about this launch as it will bring our technology to more developers who rely on AWS, and make it easier for businesses to consume Hugging Face services.

## Getting Started

Before you can connect your AWS Account with your Hugging Face account, you need to fulfill the following prerequisites: 

- Have access to an active AWS account with access to subscribe to products on the AWS Marketplace.
- Create a [Hugging Face organization account](https://huggingface.co/organizations/new) with a registered and confirmed email. (You cannot connect user accounts)
- Be a member of the Hugging Face organization you want to connect with the [‚Äúadmin‚Äù role](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/organizations-security).
- Logged into the Hugging Face Hub.

Once you meet these requirements, you can proceed with connecting your AWS and Hugging Face accounts.

Congratulations! ü•≥¬†All members of your organization can now start using Hugging Face premium services with billing directly managed by your AWS account: 

- [Inference Endpoints Deploy models in minutes](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/)
- [AutoTrain creates ML models without code](https://huggingface.co/autotrain)
- [Spaces Hardware upgrades](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-gpus)

With one more [step](https://huggingface.co/enterprise-hub-aws-marketplace), you can enable Enterprise Hub and upgrade your free Hugging Face organization with advanced security features, access controls, collaboration tools and compute options. With Enterprise Hub, companies can build AI privately and securely within our GDPR compliant and SOC2 Type 2 certified platform (more details [here](https://huggingface.co/enterprise-hub-aws-marketplace)).

Pricing for Hugging Face Hub through the AWS marketplace offer is identical to the [public Hugging Face pricing](https://huggingface.co/pricing), but will be billed through your AWS Account. You can monitor the usage and billing of your organization at any time within the Billing section of your [organization settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/organizations).
