### Business Context
As IT continues to evolve and reshape our world, creating a more diverse and inclusive environment within the industry is imperative. Witty Works was built in 2018 to address this challenge. Starting as a consulting company advising organizations on how to become more diverse, Witty Works first helped them write job ads using inclusive language. To scale this effort, in 2019 they built an app to assist users in writing inclusive job ads in English, French and German. They enlarged the scope rapidly with a writing assistant working as a browser extension which automatically fixes and explains potential bias in emails, Linkedin posts, job ads, etc. The aim was to offer a solution for both internal and external communication that fosters a cultural change by also providing micro-learning bites that explain the underlying bias of highlighted words and phrases.
