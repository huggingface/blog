# FastRTC: The Real-Time Communication Library for Python

In the last few months, many new real-time speech models have been released and entire companies have been founded around both open and closed source models. To name a few milestones:

- OpenAI and Google released their live multimodal APIs for ChatGPT and Gemini. OpenAI even went so far as to release a 1-800-ChatGPT phone number!
- Kyutai released [Moshi](https://huggingface.co/kyutai), a fully open-source audio-to-audio LLM. Alibaba released [Qwen2-Audio](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct) and Fixie.ai released [Ultravox](https://huggingface.co/fixie-ai/ultravox-v0_5-llama-3_3-70b) - two open-source LLMs that natively understand audio.
- ElevenLabs [raised $180m](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/series-c) in their Series C.

Despite the explosion on the model and funding side, it's still difficult to build real-time AI applications that stream audio and video, especially in Python.

- ML engineers may not have experience with the technologies needed to build real-time applications, such as WebRTC.
- Even code assistant tools like Cursor and Copilot struggle to write Python code that supports real-time audio/video applications. I know from experience!

That's why we're excited to announce `FastRTC`, the real-time communication library for Python. The library is designed to make it super easy to build real-time audio and video AI applications entirely in Python!

In this blog post, we'll walk through the basics of `FastRTC` by building real-time audio applications. At the end, you'll understand the core features of `FastRTC`:

- 🗣️ Automatic Voice Detection and Turn Taking built-in, so you only need to worry about the logic for responding to the user.
- 💻 Automatic UI - Built-in WebRTC-enabled Gradio UI for testing (or deploying to production!).
- 📞 Call via Phone - Use fastphone() to get a FREE phone number to call into your audio stream (HF Token required. Increased limits for PRO accounts).
- ⚡️ WebRTC and Websocket support.
- 💪 Customizable - You can mount the stream to any FastAPI app so you can serve a custom UI or deploy beyond Gradio.
- 🧰 Lots of utilities for text-to-speech, speech-to-text, stop word detection to get you started.

Let's dive in.

## Getting Started

We'll start by building the "hello world" of real-time audio: echoing back what the user says. In `FastRTC`, this is as simple as:

```python
from fastrtc import Stream, ReplyOnPause
import numpy as np

def echo(audio: tuple[int, np.ndarray]) -> tuple[int, np.ndarray]:
    yield audio

stream = Stream(ReplyOnPause(echo), modality="audio", mode="send-receive")
stream.ui.launch()
```

Let's break it down:
- The `ReplyOnPause` will handle the voice detection and turn taking for you. You just have to worry about the logic for responding to the user. Any generator that returns a tuple of audio, (represented as `(sample_rate, audio_data)`) will work.
- The `Stream` class will build a Gradio UI for you to quickly test out your stream. Once you have finished prototyping, you can deploy your Stream as a production-ready FastAPI app in a single line of code - `stream.mount(app)`. Where `app` is a FastAPI app.

Here it is in action:

## Leveling-Up: LLM Voice Chat

The next level is to use an LLM to respond to the user. `FastRTC` comes with built-in speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities, so working with LLMs is really easy. Let's change our `echo` function accordingly:

```python
import os

from fastrtc import (ReplyOnPause, Stream, get_stt_model, get_tts_model)
from openai import OpenAI

sambanova_client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("SAMBANOVA_API_KEY"), base_url="https://api.sambanova.ai/v1"
)
stt_model = get_stt_model()
tts_model = get_tts_model()

def echo(audio):
    prompt = stt_model.stt(audio)
    response = sambanova_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="Meta-Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        max_tokens=200,
    )
    prompt = response.choices[0].message.content
    for audio_chunk in tts_model.stream_tts_sync(prompt):
        yield audio_chunk

stream = Stream(ReplyOnPause(echo), modality="audio", mode="send-receive")
stream.ui.launch()
```

We're using the SambaNova API since it's fast. The `get_stt_model()` will fetch [Moonshine Base](https://huggingface.co/UsefulSensors/moonshine-base) and `get_tts_model()` will fetch [Kokoro](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) from the Hub, both of which have been further optimized for on-device CPU inference. But you can use any LLM/text-to-speech/speech-to-text API or even a speech-to-speech model. Bring the tools you love - `FastRTC` just handles the real-time communication layer.

## Bonus: Call via Phone

If instead of `stream.ui.launch()`, you call `stream.fastphone()`, you'll get a free phone number to call into your stream. Note, a Hugging Face token is required. Increased limits for PRO accounts.

You'll see something like this in your terminal:

```
INFO:	  Your FastPhone is now live! Call +1 877-713-4471 and use code 530574 to connect to your stream.
INFO:	  You have 30:00 minutes remaining in your quota (Resetting on 2025-03-23)
```

You can then call the number and it will connect you to your stream!
