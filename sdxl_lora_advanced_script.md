<h2>A community derived guide to some of the SOTA practices for SD-XL Dreambooth LoRA fine tuning
</h2>

<h3>tl;dr
</h3>

We combined the Pivotal Tuning technique used on Replicate's SDXL Cog trainer with the Prodigy optimizer used in the
Kohya trainer (plus a bunch of other optimizations) to achieve very good results on training a Dreambooth LoRA for SDXL.
[Check out the training script on diffusers]()ðŸ§¨. [Try it out on Colab]().

If you want to skip the technical talk, you can use all the techniques in this blog
and [train on Hugging Face Spaces with a simple UI]() and curated parameters (that you can meddle with).

<h3>Overview
</h3>

LoRA dreambooth fine-tuned stable diffusion xl models achieved incredible results at capturing new concepts using only a
handful of images, while simultaneously maintaining the aesthetic and image quality of sd-xl and requiring relatively
little compute and resources. Check out some of the awesome SD-XL
LoRAs [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/multimodalart/LoraTheExplorer).  
In this blog, we'll review some of the popular practices and techniques to make your LoRA finetune go brrr, and how you
can use them now with diffusers!

Recap: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a training technique for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models by making slight
adjustments to the crucial cross-attention layers where images and prompts intersect - achieving quality on par with
full fine tuned models while being much faster and requiring less compute. To learn more on how LoRAs work please see

<h2>Pivotal Tuning</h2>

Pivotal Tuning is a method that combines training Textual Inversion with regular training. For Dreambooth, it is
customary that you provide a rare token to be your trigger word, say "an sks dog", however, those tokens usually have
other semantic meaning associated with them and can affect your results. The sks example, popular in the community, is
actually associated with a weapons brand.

To tackle that issue with pivotal tuning, instead of re-using an existing token, we insert new tokens into the text
encoders of the model - and we optimize these token embeddings to represent the new concept: that is Textual Inversion -
we learn to represent the concept through new "words" in the embedding space. Once we obtain the new token and its
embeddings to represent it, we can train our Dreambooth LoRA with those token embeddings to get the best of both worlds.

**Training**

In our new training script, you can do textual inversion training by providing the following arguments

```
--train_text_encoder_ti
--train_text_encoder_ti_frac=0.5
--token_abstraction="TOK"
--num_new_tokens_per_abstraction=2
--adam_weight_decay_text_encoder
```

* `train_text_encoder_ti` activates the training the embeddings of new concepts
* `train_text_encoder_ti_frac` and tells us when to stop optimizing such new concepts. Pivoting halfway is the default
  value in the cog sdxl example and we have seen good results with it. We encourage experimentation here.`
* `token_abstraction` lets you choose a word to use in your instance prompt, validation prompt or custom captions to
  represent the new tokens being trained. Here we chose TOK. So, for example, "a photo of a TOK" as an instance prompt
  would then insert the newly trained tokens in place of TOK`
* `num_new_tokens_per_abstraction` sets up how many new tokens to insert and train its embeddings for each text encoder
  of the model. The default is set to 2, but you can increase that for complex concepts.`
* `Adam_weight_decay_text_encoder` This is used to set a different weight decay value for the text encoder parameters (
  different from the value used for the unet parameters).`

**Inference**

When doing pivotal tuning, besides the `*.safetensors` weights of your LoRA, you also get the `*.safetensors` embeddings
for the new tokens. In order to do inference with those we add 2 steps to how we would load normally where we:

1. Download our trained embeddings from the hub

```
import torch
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download, upload_file
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
from diffusers.models import AutoencoderKL
from safetensors.torch import load_file
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
        "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
        torch_dtype=torch.float16,
        variant="fp16",
).to("cuda")
# normal LoRA loading
pipe.load_lora_weights("LinoyTsaban/linoy_v9", weight_name="pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors")
```

2. Load these into the text encoders

```
# download embeddings
embedding_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="LinoyTsaban/web_y2k_v3", filename="embeddings.safetensors", repo_type="model")
# load embeddings to the text encoders
state_dict = load_file(embedding_path)

pipe.load_textual_inversion(state_dict["text_encoders_0"][0], token=["<s0>"], text_encoder=pipe.text_encoder, tokenizer=pipe.tokenizer)
pipe.load_textual_inversion(state_dict["text_encoders_0"][1], token=["<s1>"], text_encoder=pipe.text_encoder, tokenizer=pipe.tokenizer)

pipe.load_textual_inversion(state_dict["text_encoders_1"][0], token=["<s0>"], text_encoder=pipe.text_encoder_2, tokenizer=pipe.tokenizer_2)
pipe.load_textual_inversion(state_dict["text_encoders_1"][1], token=["<s1>"], text_encoder=pipe.text_encoder_2, tokenizer=pipe.tokenizer_2)
```

3. Prompt your LoRA!

```
prompt="a <s0><s1> webpage about an astronaut riding a horse"
images = pipe(
    prompt,
    cross_attention_kwargs={"scale": 0.8},
).images
#your output image
images[0]
```

`<astronaut image>`

<h2>Adaptive Optimizers</h2>

`loss animation`

When training/fine-tuning a diffusion model (or any machine learning model for that matter), we use optimizers to guide
us towards the optimal path that leads to convergence of our training objective - a minimum point of our chosen loss
function that represents a state where the model learned what we are trying to teach it. The standard (and
state-of-the-art) choices for deep learning tasks are the Adam and AdamW optimizers.

However, they require the user to meddle a lot with the hyperparameters that pave the path to convergence (such as
learning rate, weight decay, etc.). This can result in time-consuming experiments that lead to suboptimal outcomes, and
even if you land on an ideal learning rate, it may still lead to convergence issues if the learning rate is constant
during training. Some parameters may benefit from more frequent updates to expedite convergence, while others may
require smaller adjustments to avoid overshooting the optimal value. To tackle this challenge, algorithms with adaptable
learning rates such as **Adafactor** and [**Prodigy**](https://github.com/konstmish/prodigy) have been introduced. These
methods optimize the algorithm's traversal of the optimization landscape by dynamically adjusting the learning rate for
each parameter based on their past gradients.

We chose to focus a bit more on Prodigy as we think it can be especially beneficial for Dreambooth LoRA training!

**Training**

```
--optimizer="prodigy"
```

When using prodigy it's generally good practice to set-

```
--learning_rate=1.0
```

Additional settings that are considered beneficial for diffusion models and specifically LoRA training are:

```
--prodigy_safeguard_warmup=True
--prodigy_use_bias_correction=True
--adam_beta1=0.9
# Note these are set to values different than the default:
--adam_beta2=0.99 
--adam_weight_decay=0.01
```

There are additional hyper-parameters you can adjust when training with prodigy
(like- `--prodigy_beta3`, `prodigy_decouple`, `prodigy_safeguard_warmup`), we will not delve into those in this post,
but you can learn more about them [here](https://github.com/konstmish/prodigy).

<h2>More Popular Practices</h2>

Besides pivotal tuning and adaptive optimizers, here are some additional techniques that can impact the quality of your
trained LoRA, all of them have been incorporated into the new diffusers training script.

* <h3>separate learning rate for text-encoder and unet</h3>

  When optimizing the text encoder, it's been perceived by the community that setting different learning rates for it (
  versus the learning rate of the Unet) can lead to better quality results - specifically a **lower** learning rate for
  the text encoder as it tends to overfit _faster_.
    * The importance of different unet and text encoder learning rates is evident when performing pivotal tuning as
      well- in this case, setting a higher learning rate for the text encoder is perceived to be better.
    * Notice, however, that when using Prodigy (or adaptive optimizers in general) - we start with an identical initial
      learning rate for all trained parameters, and let the optimizer work it's magic âœ¨

**Training**

```
--train_text_encoder
--learning_rate=1e-4 #unet
--text_encoder_lr=5e-5 
```

```
--train_text_encoder - Enables full text encoder training (i.e. Text Encoders weights are optimized vs. textual inversion (--train_text_encoder_ti) where we optimize embeddings but don't modify the weights)
If you wish the text encoder lr to always match --learning_rate, set --text_encoder_lr=None

```

* <h3>Custom Captioning</h3>

  While it is possible to achieve good results by training on a set of images all captioned with the same instance
  prompt, e.g. "photo of a <token> person" or "in the style of <token>" etc. Using the same caption may lead to
  suboptimal results, depending on the complexity of the learned concept, how "familiar" the model is with the concept,
  and how well the training set captures it.
* [meme]()

**Training** 
To use custom captioning, first ensure that you have the datasets library installed, otherwise you can
  install it by -

```
!pip install datasets
```

To load the custom captions we need our training set directory to follow the structure of a datasets ImageFolder, containing both the images and the corresponding caption for each image.

* _Option 1_: 
    You choose a dataset from the hub that already contains images and prompts - for example XXX. Now all you have to do is


```

--dataset_name= 
--caption_column=

```



* _Option 2_:
You wish to use your own images and add captions to them. In that case, you can use [this colab notebook]() to automatically
caption the images with BLIP, or you can manually create the captions in a metadata file. Then you follow up the same
way, by specifying `--dataset_name` with your folder path, and `--caption_column` with the column name for the captions
