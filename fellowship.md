The 🤗 Fellowship is a network of exceptional people from different backgrounds who contribute to the open source ecosystem of Machine Learning 🚀. Our goal is to empower the key contributors and enable them to scale their impact while inspiring others to contribute as well.

## How the Fellowship works 🙌🏻

There are no strings attached with the 🤗 Fellowship. This is Hugging Face supporting the amazing work of contributors! Being a Fellow works differently for everyone. The key question here is:

❓ **What would you need to be more impactful? How can we support you so you can do that project you have always wanted to do?**

Fellows of all backgrounds are welcome! The progress of Machine Learning depends on grassroots contributions. Each person has a unique set of knowledge that can be used to democratize our field in a variety of ways. Each Fellow achieves impact differently and that is perfect 🌈. We will support you to continue creating and sharing the way you find the best 🤗.

## What are the benefits of being part of the Fellowship? 🤩

The benefits will be based on the interests of each individual. Some examples of how we can support you:

💾 Computing and Resources 😏

🎎 Network of expert peers with whom fellows can collaborate.

🧑🏻‍💻 Exclusive workshops and support from the Hugging Face team!

🤗 Direct contact with the HF team, including insight into the latest projects, features, and more!

🎁 Exclusive merchandise and assets.

✨ By being officially recognized as a Fellow, your career could be boosted.

## Do you want to be a Fellow?

Fellows are currently nominated by members of the Hugging Face team or by another Fellow. How can you get noticed? This is the main criteria:

- You have advanced the goal of democratizing good, open source machine learning.

How? In the way you prefer. These are some examples of the first Fellows:

- **María Grandury** - She created the [largest NLP community](https://somosnlp.org/) in Spanish. Then she organized a Hackathon that achieved more than 20 models that advanced the SOTA for Spanish. 👩🏼‍🎤
- **Manuel Romero** - He contributed [over 300 models](https://huggingface.co/mrm8488) to the Hugging Face Hub. He has trained multiple SOTA models in Spanish and has contributed to many different efforts. 🤴🏻
- **Aritra Roy Gosthipathy**: Contributed new architectures for TensorFlow in the transformers library and helped create the Keras working group. 🦹🏻
- **Vaibhav Srivastav** - Advocacy in the field of speech. He has led the ML4Audio working group, paper discussion sessions, and contributed to setting up Discord. 🦹🏻
- **Bram Vanroy** - Helped many contributors and the Hugging Face team early on both GitHub and the forum 🦸🏼
- **Christopher Akiki** - Helped the Hugging Face team on many fronts, contributed to sprints, organized workshops! 🦹🏻‍♀️
- **Ceyda Çınarel** - Contributed to many Hugging Face models in various sprints! 👸🏻

Additionally, there are strategic areas where Hugging Face is looking for open source contributions. These areas will be added and updated frequently on the [one-pager of the Fellowship](https://huggingface2.notion.site/Hugging-Fellows-One-Pager-fa1c8878a7a14945b7e0dda2d1e34f36). Do not hesitate to send a direct message to [Merve Noyan](https://twitter.com/mervenoyann) or (Omar Espejel)(https://twitter.com/espejelomar) if you wish to undertake a project in these areas or be considered as a Fellow.

We are actively working to build a culture that values ​​diversity, equity, and inclusion. We are intentionally building a community where people feel respected and supported, regardless of who they are or where they come from. We believe this is critical to building the future of open Machine Learning. The Fellowship will not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* **I'm starting to contribute. Can I be a fellow?**<br>Preferably people with more contributions are accepted as Fellows. That said, the program is flexible and we might consider it especially if you have the potential to contribute on strategic fronts.

* **Will I be an employee of Hugging Face?**<br>No, the Fellowship does not mean you are an employee of Hugging Face. However, feel free to mention in any forum, including LinkedIn, that you are a Hugging Face Fellow. Also, Hugging Face is constantly hiring and this *could* be a good door for a bigger relationship in the future 😎.

* **Will I receive benefits during the Residency?**<br>Yes, the benefits will depend on the particular needs and projects that each Fellow wants to undertake.

* **How ​​can I contribute?**<br>In whatever way you think will have the greatest impact on the mission of democratizing good machine learning. In addition, we will constantly add strategic areas of contribution in the [Fellowship's one-pager](https://huggingface2.notion.site/Hugging-Fellows-One-Pager-fa1c8878a7a14945b7e0dda2d1e34f36).

* **Is there a deadline?**<br>No. Admission to the program is ongoing and contingent on the nomination of a current Fellow or member of the Hugging Face team. Please note that being nominated may not be enough to be admitted as a Fellow.
