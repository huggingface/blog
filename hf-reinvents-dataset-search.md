# Hugging Face Reinvents Dataset Search With 4 New Features

The AI and ML community is sharing more than 180,000 public datasets on The [Hugging Face Dataset Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) to train and evaluate models.
Researchers and engineers are using these datasets for various tasks, from training LLMs to chat with users to evaluating automatic speech recognition or computer vision systems.
Datasets discoverability and vizualisation are key challenges to let AI builders find, explore and transform datasets to fit their use cases.

At Hugging Face we are building the Dataset Hub to be the best place for the community to collaborate on AI datasets.
So we built tools like Dataset Search, Dataset Viewer, as well as a rich open source ecosystem of tools.
Today we are announcing 4 new features that will take Dataset Search on the Hub to the next level.
