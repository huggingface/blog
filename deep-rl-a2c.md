[In Unit 5](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-pg), we learned about our first Policy-Based algorithm called **Reinforce**. 
Indeed, in Policy-Based methods, **we aim to optimize the policy directly without using a value function**. More precisely, Reinforce is part of a subclass of *Policy-Based Methods* called *Policy-Gradient methods*. This subclass optimizes the policy directly by **estimating the weights of the optimal policy using Gradient Ascent**.

We saw that Reinforce worked well. However, because we use Monte-Carlo sampling to estimate return (we use an entire episode to calculate the return), **we have significant variance in policy gradient estimation**. 

Remember that the policy gradient estimation is **the direction of the steepest increase in return**. Aka, how to update our policy weights so that actions that lead to good returns have a higher probability of being taken. This variance that will study in this unit **leads to slower training since we need a lot of samples to mitigate it**.

So today, we'll study an **Actor-Critic method**, a hybrid architecture combining a value-based and policy-based methods that help to stabilize the training by reducing the variance:
- *An Actor* that controls **how our agent behaves** (policy-based method)
- *A Critic* that measures **how good the action taken is** (value-based method)

We'll study one of these "hybrid methods, " Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), a**nd train our agent using Stable-Baselines3 in robotic environments**. Where we'll train two agents to walk:
- A bipedal walker ü¶ø
- A spider üï∏Ô∏è


Sounds exciting? Let's get started!
