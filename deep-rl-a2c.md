[In Unit 5](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-pg), we learned about our first Policy-Based algorithm called **Reinforce**. 
Indeed, in Policy-Based methods, **we aim to optimize the policy directly without using a value function**. More precisely, Reinforce is part of a subclass of *Policy-Based Methods* called *Policy-Gradient methods*. This subclass optimizes the policy directly by **estimating the weights of the optimal policy using Gradient Ascent**.

We saw that Reinforce worked well. However, because we use Monte-Carlo sampling to estimate return (we use an entire episode to calculate the return), **we have significant variance in policy gradient estimation**. 

Remember that the policy gradient estimation is **the direction of the steepest increase in return**. Aka, how to update our policy weights so that actions that lead to good returns have a higher probability of being taken. This variance that will study in this unit **leads to slower training since we need a lot of samples to mitigate it**.

So today, we'll study an **Actor-Critic method**, a hybrid architecture combining a value-based and policy-based methods that help to stabilize the training by reducing the variance:
- *An Actor* that controls **how our agent behaves** (policy-based method)
- *A Critic* that measures **how good the action taken is** (value-based method)

We'll study one of these "hybrid methods, " Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), a**nd train our agent using Stable-Baselines3 in robotic environments**. Where we'll train two agents to walk:
- A bipedal walker ü¶ø
- A spider üï∏Ô∏è

Sounds exciting? Let's get started!

## The Problem of Variance in Reinforce
In Reinforce, we want to **increase the probability of actions in a trajectory proportional to the goodness of the return**.

<img src="https://huggingface.co/blog/assets/85_policy_gradient/pg.jpg" alt="Reinforce"/>
  
- If the **return is high**, we will **push up** the probabilities of the (state, action) combinations.
- Else, if the **return is low**, it will **push down** the probabilities of the (state, action) combinations.

This return \\(R(\tau)\\) is calculated using a *Monte-Carlo sampling*. Indeed, we collect a trajectory and calculate the discounted return, **and use this score to increase or decrease the probability of every action taken in that trajectory**. If the return is good, all actions will be ‚Äúreinforced‚Äù by increasing their likelihood of being taken.
  
\\(R(\tau) = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + ...\\) 

The advantage of this method is that **it‚Äôs unbiased. Since we‚Äôre not estimating the return**, we use only the true return we obtain.
  
But the problem is that **the variance is high, since trajectories can lead to different returns** due to stochasticity of the environment (random events during episode) and stochasticity of the policy. Consequently, the same starting state can lead to very different returns.
And so, **the return starting at the same state can vary significantly across episodes**.

The solution is to mitigate the variance by¬†**using a large number of trajectories, hoping that the variance introduced in any one trajectory will be reduced in aggregate and provide a "true" estimation of the return.**

However, increasing the batch size significantly reduces sample efficiency. So we need to find additional mechanisms to reduce the variance.

## Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)
### Reducing variance with Actor-Critic methods
The solution to reducing the variance of Reinforce algorithm and training our agent faster and better is to use a combination of policy-based and value-based methods: *the Actor-Critic method*.

To understand the Actor-Critic, imagine you play a video game. You can play with a friend that will provide you with some feedback. You‚Äôre the Actor, and your friend is the Critic.
 
<img src="assets/89_deep_rl_a2c/ac.jpg" alt="Actor Critic"/>  

You don‚Äôt know how to play at the beginning, **so you try some actions randomly**. The Critic observes your action and **provides feedback**.

Learning from this feedback,¬†**you‚Äôll update your policy and be better at playing that game.**

On the other hand, your friend (Critic) will also update their way to provide feedback so it can be better next time.

This is the idea behind Actor-Critic. We learn two function approximations:

- *A policy* that **controls how our agent acts**: (// \pi_{\theta}(s,a) //)
  
- *A value function* to assist the policy update by measuring how good the action taken is: (// \hat{\q}_{w}(s,a) //)
 
### The Actor-Critic Process
Now that we have seen the Actor Critic's big picture, let's dive deeper to understand how Actor and Critic improve together during the training.
  
So we saw with Actor-Critic methods, we have two function approximations (two neural networks):
- *Actor*, a **policy function** parameterized by theta: (// \pi_{\theta}(s,a) //)
- *Critic*, a **value function** parameterized by w: (// \hat{\q}_{w}(s,a) //)

Let's see the training process to understand how Actor and Critic are optimized:
- At each timestep, t, we get the current state (\\ S_t\\) from the environment and **pass it as input through our Actor and Critic**.
  
- Our Policy takes the state and **outputs an action**  (\\ A_t \\).
  
<img src="assets/89_deep_rl_a2c/step1.jpg" alt="Step 1 Actor Critic"/>  
  
- The Critic takes that action also as input and, using (\\ S_t\\) and (\\ A_t \\), **computes the value of taking that action at that state: the Q-value**.
  
<img src="assets/89_deep_rl_a2c/step2.jpg" alt="Step 2 Actor Critic"/>  
  
- The action (\\ A_t\\) performed in the environment outputs a new state (\\ S_{t+1}\\) and a reward (\\ R_{t+1}\\) .
  
<img src="assets/89_deep_rl_a2c/step3.jpg" alt="Step 3 Actor Critic"/>
  
- The Actor updates its policy parameters using the Q value.
  
<img src="assets/89_deep_rl_a2c/step4.jpg" alt="Step 4 Actor Critic"/>  
  
- Thanks to its updated parameters, the Actor produces the next action to take at At+1 given the new state St+1. 
  
- The Critic then updates its value parameters.
